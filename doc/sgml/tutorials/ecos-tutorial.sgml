<TITLE>Foreword</TITLE>
<PARA>Welcome to the latest release of Red Hat eCos(TM) - the Embedded
    Configurable Operating System.</PARA>

<!-- ==================================================== -->

<SECT1 ID="FOREWORD-WHATS-NEW">
<TITLE>What's New?</TITLE>
<PARA>In the fourth major public release of eCos, starting with
version 1.4, we have added a wealth of new features, enhancements,
and have further extended the target platform coverage.</PARA>
<PARA>Major new elements include: </PARA>
<ITEMIZEDLIST>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>Package management that supports the extension of eCos
	  functionality via third party add-on packages.</PARA>
</LISTITEM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>A standardized configuration save file format that is
human readable and editable, and compatible between both GUI and
command line configuration tools.</PARA>
</LISTITEM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>Enhanced web based help and component documentation system
integrated into the GUI configuration tool.</PARA>
</LISTITEM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>The Component Definition Language (CDL) has been radically
revised and has now been implemented as a TCL extension for maximum
flexibility. CDL is now fully documented in the Component Writers
Guide.</PARA>
</LISTITEM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>Template support for straightforward control of multiple
configuration elements, which can be used to provide easy access
to standard eCos configurations such as a debug stub boot ROM.</PARA>
</LISTITEM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>Best of all, the source of the new configuration tools
and underlying libCDL technology has been open sourced under the
GNU Public License (GPL).</PARA>
</LISTITEM>
</ITEMIZEDLIST>
<PARA>A companion beta version of the eCos TCP/IP stack
has been released in conjunction with this release. The stack is
derived from the OpenBSD source base and provides UDP, TCP, ICMP,
BOOTP and DHCP protocol support on an IPv4 standards base. Device
driver support for Cirrus Logic EP72xx evaluation boards, Motorola
MBX, and StrongARM EBSA285 with Intel 82559 is included. The stack
and ethernet core support are distributed as configurable eCos packages. Platform
ethernet device drivers are distributed with the associated platform
HAL, but are naturally not useful without the ethernet core support
package.</PARA>
<PARA>A PCI bus support library has also been added that provides
generic PCI bus based device initialization, discovery, and configuration.
The library has been ported to both the VR4300 DDB-VRC4373 and StrongARM
EBSA285 development boards.</PARA>
<PARA>eCos also contains support for the POSIX Specification (ISO/IEC
9945-1)[POSIX]. This support follows EL/IX
level 1 in the functionality supplied [ELIX].</PARA>
<PARA>POSIX support is divided between the POSIX and the FILEIO
packages. The POSIX package provides support for threads, signals,
synchronization, timers and message queues. The FILEIO package provides
support for file and device I/O. The two packages may be
used together or separately, depending on configuration.</PARA>
<PARA>Also supplied with eCos is RedBoot; the standard bootstrap
and debugging environment for embedded systems from Red Hat.  It
provides a wide set of tools for downloading and executing programs
on embedded target systems, as well as tools for manipulating the
target system's environment.</PARA>
<PARA>RedBoot's capabilities include:   </PARA>
<ITEMIZEDLIST>

<PARA>Red Hat is dedicated to continued enhancement and maintenance
of the eCos system. Developers can look forward to upcoming releases
that further expand the architectural and board coverage, extend
the functionality of the TCP/IP stack, add a Linux version
of the GUI configuration tool, and add major new features such as a
Linux/Posix compatibility layer based on the upcoming EL/IX
standard - see <ULINK URL="http://sources.redhat.com/elix/">http://sources.redhat.com/elix/</ULINK>
for more details.</PARA>

<!-- ==================================================== -->

<SECT1 ID="FOREWORD-ECOS-IN-A-NUTSHELL">
<TITLE>eCos in a Nutshell</TITLE>
<PARA>eCos is an open source, configurable, portable, and
	royalty-free embedded real-time operating system. The
	following text expands on these core aspects that define
	eCos.</PARA>
<PARA>eCos is provided as an open source runtime system
	supported by the Red Hat GNUPro and GNU open source
	development tools. Developers have full and unfettered access
	to all aspects of the runtime system. No parts of it are
	proprietary or hidden, and you are at liberty to examine, add
	to, and modify the code as you deem necessary. These rights
	are granted to you and protected by the Red Hat eCos Public
	License (RHEPL). It also grants you the right to freely
	develop and distribute applications based on eCos. You are not
	expected or required to make your embedded applications or any
	additional components that you develop freely available,
	although we do require that you make publicly available any
	modifications to the eCos code itself. Red Hat of course
	welcomes all contributions back to eCos such as board ports,
	device drivers and other components, as this helps the growth
	and development of eCos, and is of benefit to the entire eCos
	community.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the key technological innovations in eCos is our
	configuration system. The configuration system allows the
	application writer to impose their requirements on the
	run-time components, both in terms of their functionality and
	implementation, whereas traditionally the operating system has
	constrained the application's own implementation. Essentially,
	this enables eCos developers to create their own
	application-specific operating system and makes eCos suitable
	for a wide range of embedded uses. Configuration also ensures
	that the resource footprint of eCos is minimized as all
	unnecessary functionality and features are removed. The
	configuration system also presents eCos as a component
	architecture. This provides a standardized mechanism for
	component suppliers to extend the functionality of eCos and
	allows applications to be built from a wide set of optional
	configurable run-time components. Components can be provided
	from a variety of sources including: the standard eCos
	release; commercial third party developers; open source
	contributors; or additional optional components from Red
	Hat.</PARA>
<PARA>The royalty-free nature of eCos means that you can develop
and deploy your application using the standard eCos release without
incurring any royalty charges. In addition, there are no up-front
license charges for the eCos runtime source code and associated
tools. We provide, without charge, everything necessary for basic embedded
applications development.</PARA>
<PARA>eCos is designed to be portable to a wide range of target
architectures and target platforms including 16, 32, and 64 bit
architectures, MPUs, MCUs and DSPs. The eCos kernel, libraries and
runtime components are layered on the Hardware Abstraction Layer
(HAL), and thus will run on any target once the HAL and relevant
device drivers have been ported to the target's processor
architecture and board. Currently eCos supports a large range of
different target architectures (ARM, Hitachi SH3, Intel x86, MIPS,
Matsushita AM3x, Intel StrongARM, NEC V850, Motorola PowerPC, and
SPARC) including many of the popular variants of these architectures
and evaluation boards. Many new ports are in development and will
be released as they become available.</PARA>
<PARA>eCos has been designed to support applications with real-time
requirements, providing features such as full preemptability, minimal
interrupt latencies, and all the necessary synchronization primitives,
scheduling policies, and interrupt handling mechanisms needed for
these type of applications. eCos also provides all the functionality
required for general embedded application support including device
drivers, memory management, exception handling, C, math libraries,
etc. In addition to runtime support, the eCos system includes all
the tools necessary to develop embedded applications, including
eCos software configuration and build tools, and GNU based compilers,
assemblers, linkers, debuggers, and simulators.</PARA>
<PARA>To get the most out of eCos you should visit the eCos open
source developers site: <ULINK URL="http://sources.redhat.com/ecos/">http://sources.redhat.com/ecos/</ULINK></PARA>
<PARA>The site is dedicated to the eCos developer community and
      contains a rich set of resources including news, FAQ, online
      documentation, installation guide, discussion and announcement
      mailing lists, online problem report form, and runtime and
      development tools downloads. We also support anonymous CVS and
      WEBCVS access to provide you with direct access to the very
      latest eCos source base. Complementing the open source
      developers site is an eCos product site, featuring news, press
      releases, details of our commercial engineering and support
      services, products, and third party partner offerings. This is
      located at <ULINK URL="http://www.redhat.com/embedded/technologies/ecos/">http://www.redhat.com/embedded/technologies/ecos/</ULINK></PARA>
<PARA>We have released eCos as open source software because we
      believe that this is the most effective software development
      model, and that it provides the greatest benefit to the embedded
      developer community as a whole. As part of this endeavor, we
      seek the input and participation of eCos developers in its
      continuing evolution. Participation can take many forms
      including:</PARA>
<ITEMIZEDLIST>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>providing us with feedback on how eCos might be made more
useful to you - by taking part in the ongoing mailing list discussions
and by submitting problem reports covering bugs, documentation issues,
and missing features</PARA>
</LISTITEM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>contributing bug fixes and enhancement patches</PARA>
</LISTITEM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>contributing new code including device drivers, board
ports, libraries, and other runtime components</PARA>
</LISTITEM>
</ITEMIZEDLIST>
<PARA>Our long term aim is to make eCos a rich and ubiquitous standard
infrastructure for the development of deeply embedded applications.
This will be achieved in part by Red Hat's own efforts,
but also with the assistance of the eCos developer community cooperating
to improve eCos for all. I would like to take this opportunity to
extend our thanks to the many eCos developers who have already contributed
feedback, ideas, patches, and code that have augmented and improved this
release.</PARA>
<PARA>On behalf of the eCos team, welcome to the eCos developer
      community.</PARA>

<PARA>eCos comes with two ROM images that provide GDB support for
the ARM PID board. The first ROM image provides a port of the CygMon
ROM monitor, which includes a command-line interface and a GDB remote
stub. The second ROM image provides a remote GDB stub only, which
is a minimal environment for downloading and debugging eCos programs
solely using GDB.</PARA>
<PARA>eCos, CygMon and the GDB stubs all support the PID fitted

be programmed into either the programmable ROM (U12) or the FLASH

loaders/arm-pid under the root of your eCos installation,
along with a tool that will program the stubs into the FLASH memory on
the board. CygMon images are prefixed with the name 'cygmon' and
GDB stub ROM images are given the prefix 'gdb_module'.
Images may be provided in a number of formats including ELF (.img
extension), binary (.bin extension) and SREC (.srec extension).

<PARA>eCos comes with two Flash ROM images that provide GDB support
for the Cirrus Logic EP7211 Development Board (also known as the
EDB7211).. Note that on some board revisions, the board is silk-screened
as EDB7111-2. The first Flash ROM image provides a port of the CygMon
ROM monitor, which includes a command-line interface and a GDB remote
stub. The second Flash ROM image provides a remote GDB stub only.</PARA>
<PARA>Both ROM images are provided in the directory loaders/arm-edb7211

<PARA>The ROM images provided for the EP7211 Development Board must

<PARA>Both Cygmon and GDB Stub ROMS allow communication with GDB
via the serial connector labelled 'UART 1'. The
communication parameters are fixed at 38400 baud, 8 data bits, no
parity bit and 1 stop bit (8-N-1). No flow control is employed.
Connection to the host computer should be made using a null modem cable.
A gender changer may also be required. Note that the GDB Configuration tool
uses the serial port identifiers 0 and 1 to identify the EB7211
serial ports UART1 and UART2 respectively.</PARA>
<PARA>Both eCos and the ROM images assume the core clock is generated
with a 3.6864 MHz PLL input. The CPU will be configured to run at
73.728MHz.</PARA>

<TITLE>Loading the ROM Image into On-board Flash</TITLE>
<PARA>There are several ways to install the eCos gdb stub ROM image
in the EBSA board&rsquo;s flash memory. Once installed, the gdb
stub ROM provides standard eCos download and debug via the EBSA
board&quot;s serial port. The options available include the
Linux based EBSA flash upgrade utility provided by Red Hat, direct writing
of the flash via MultiICE (JTAG) hardware debugger, and other flash management
utilities from Intel (these only support DOS, and proprietary ARM tools
and image formats). Only the Red Hat flash upgrade tool is supported
and tested in this release.</PARA>
<PARA>The flash upgrade tool requires the EBSA board to be configured
as a PCI slave (rather than a master, its normal operating mode)
and plugged into a Linux host computer&quot;s PCI bus.</PARA>
<PARA>Configuring the board for flash loading: Follow the instructions
in the EBSA-285 Reference Manual, pages A-2 and A-3 to configure
the board as an add-in card, and enable flash blank programming.
 Briefly: assuming the board was in the default setting to execute
as a bus master ("Host Bridge") make jumper 9 (J9), move jumper
10 (J10) to external reset (PCI_RST), and move jumper 15
(J15) link 4-6-5 to connect 5-6 instead of 4-6.</PARA>
<PARA>Configuring the board for execution of eCos programs: Follow
the instructions in the EBSA-285 Reference Manual, pages A-2 and
A-3 to configure the board as a "Host Bridge" with "Central Function".
 Briefly: unset J9, move J10 to on-board reset (BRD_RST),
and set J15 to make 4-6 instead of 5-6 (see page A-8 also).  Plug
the card into its own PCI bus, not the Linux PC used for the flash-programming
process.</PARA>
<PARA>Building the Linux software: the Linux software sources are
in directory</PARA>
<PROGRAMLISTING>      &lt;BASEDIR&#62;/packages/hal/arm/ebsa285/v1_3/support/linux/safl_util</PROGRAMLISTING>
<PARA>in the eCos source repository.  There are two parts to the
system: a loadable kernel module and the flash utility.  The loadable
kernel module is safl.o and the utility is sa_flash.  To
build:</PARA>
<PARA>  cd to this directory, or a copy of it.</PARA>
<PARA>  make</PARA>
<PARA>This builds safl.o and sa_flash. The kernel module
must be installed, and a device file created for it. Both of these
operations require root permissions.  Create the device file by: </PARA>
<PROGRAMLISTING>      % mknod /dev/safl c 10 178</PROGRAMLISTING>
<PARA>Programming the flash: switch off the EBSA-285, and remove
the EBSA-285 board from its PCI bus.  Take appropriate anti-static
precautions. Configure it for flash loading as above, halt your
Linux system and turn it off.  Install the EBSA-285 board in the
PCI bus of the Linux system and boot it up. (Single user is good enough,
assuming your image and safl_util build dir are on a local
disc partition.)  Change directory to the safl_util directory,
then, to load the kernel module and flash an image onto the eval
board (as root): </PARA>
<PROGRAMLISTING>       % insmod safl.o
       % sa_flash &lt;image_file&#62;</PROGRAMLISTING>
<PARA>Halt and turn off the Linux machine and remove the EBSA-285
card.  Take appropriate anti-static precautions.  Configure it for
execution of eCos programs as above, and plug it into its own PCI
bus.  Restart the Linux machine however you wish.</PARA>
<PARA>This information is replicated in the README file within the
safl_util directory and its parents, and in the EBSA-285
Reference Manual from Intel, appendix A "Configuration Guide". 
If in doubt, please refer to those documents also.</PARA>
<PARA>This procedure also applies for loading ROM-startup eCos programs
into the on-board flash memory, given a binary format image of the
program from arm-elf-objcopy.  Loading a ROM-startup eCos program
into flash will overwrite the StubROM in flash, so you would have
to reload the StubROM to return to normal RAM-startup program development.</PARA>

<TITLE>Running your eCos Program Using GDB and the StubROM</TITLE>

<PARA>which will report locations and sizes of sections as they

<PROGRAMLISTING>      (gdb) continue</PROGRAMLISTING>
<PARA>If you have no eCos program yet, but you want to connect to
the board just to verify serial communications, tell gdb "set endian
little" before anything else, so that it understands the board (GDB
normally infers this from information within the eCos program).</PARA>
<NOTE>
<PARA>When an eCos program is run on the EBSA-285 board, the GDB
stub in ROM loses control. This means that if you require the ability
to stop execution on the target remotely, or want thread debugging
capabilities, you must include GDB stub support when configuring

<TITLE>V850-ELF-GDB EXECUTION</TITLE>
<PARA>Run the v850-elf-gdb client to debug the V850 target.  It
is necessary to issue certain configuration commands to the I.C.E.
software.  These commands may be issued directly in the MDI window
or they may be issued from the gdb client through the "monitor"
command.</PARA>
<PARA>On the Cosmo CEB-V850 board, on-chip Flash is mapped at address
0x0, the on-board EPROM at 0x100000 and the on-board RAM at 0xfc0000.
Since a standalone V850 will start executing from address 0x0 on
reset, it is normal to load either an application or a bootstrap
loader for Flash at this address. eCos programs may be built to
boot from Flash or the on-board EPROM. If building for the on-board
EPROM, it would be expected that the Flash will contain the default
CEB-V850 flash contents. An ELF format version of the default contents
may be found in the eCos distribution with the name v850flash.img.</PARA>
<PARA>In standalone operation, normally the code in this flash image
would have been programmed into the V850 on the Cosmo board, and
this would cause it to vector into the on-board EPROM to run the
application located there. In the case of eCos, this application
may be a GDB stub ROM application, allowing the further download
to RAM over serial of actual applications to debug.</PARA>
<PARA>As an example, we shall demonstrate how to use the I.C.E.
to download the v850flash.img and GDB stub EPROM image using I.C.E.
emulator memory only, and not requiring any actual programming of
devices.</PARA>

<PARA>NOTE: The four "monitor step" commands are only required the
first time the board is connected to the I.C.E., otherwise the program
will fail.</PARA>
<PARA>This is because of a limitation of the I.C.E. hardware that
means that the first time it is used, the "map" commands are not
acted on and the addresses "0x100000" and "0xfc0000" are not mapped.
This can be observed using the command "td e-20" in the MDI application&quot;s
console to display the trace buffer, which will show that the contents
of address 0x100000 are not valid. Subsequent runs do not require
the "monitor step" commands.</PARA>
<PARA>It is unusual to load two executable images to a target through
gdb.  From the example above notice that this is accomplished by
attaching to the libremote server, loading the flash image, detaching,
reattaching, and loading the ROM/RAM image. It is more
normal to build an executable image that can be executed directly.
In eCos this is achieved by selecting either the ROM or ROMRAM startup
type, and optionally enable building for the internal FLASH. The
I.C.E. emulator memory can emulate both the internal FLASH and the
EPROM, so real hardware programming is not required.</PARA>
<PARA>Upon running this example you will notice that the libremote
server does not exit upon detecting a detach request, but simply
begins listening for the next attach request.  To cause v850ice
to terminate, issue the "monitor quit" or "monitor exit" command
from the gdb client.  v850ice will then terminate with the next
detach request.  (You can also enter control-c in the Cygwin/DOS
window where v850ice is running.)</PARA>

<TITLE>MDI INTERFACE VS. GDB INTERFACE</TITLE>
<PARA>If a filename is referenced in an MDI command, whether the
command is entered in the MDI window or issued from the gdb client
with the monitor command, the file must reside on the Windows NT
libremote server system.  When specifying a filename when entering
a command in the MDI window it is obvious that a server local file
is being referenced.  When issuing an MDI command from the gdb client, the
user must remember that the command line is simply passed to the
I.C.E. software on the server system.  The command is executed by
the I.C.E. software as though it were entered locally.</PARA>
<PARA>Executable images may be loaded into the V850 target by entering
the "load" command in the MDI window or with the gdb "load" command.
 If the MDI load command is used, the executable image must be located
on the server system and must be in S Record format.  If the gdb
load command is used, the executable image must be located on the
client system and must be in ELF format.</PARA>
<PARA>Be aware that the gdb client is not aware of debugger commands
issued from the MDI window.  It is possible to cause the gdb client
and the I.C.E. software to get out of sync by issuing commands from
both interfaces during the same debugging session.</PARA>

<TITLE>eCos THREAD DEBUGGING</TITLE>
<PARA>eCos and the V850 I.C.E. libremote server have been written
to work together to allow debugging of eCos threads. This is an
optional feature, disabled by default because of the overheads trying
to detect a threaded program involves.</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously thread debugging is not possible for programs with
"RAM" startup type, as they are expected to operate underneath a
separate ROM monitor (such as a GDB stub ROM), that itself would
provide its own thread debugging capabilities over the serial line.
Thread debugging is relevant only for programs built for Flash, ROM,
or ROMRAM startup.</PARA>
<PARA>To configure the libremote server to support thread debugging,
use the command:</PARA>
<PARA><PROGRAMLISTING>(gdb) monitor syscallinfo ADDRESS</PROGRAMLISTING></PARA>
<PARA>at the GDB console prompt, where ADDRESS is the address of
the syscall information structure included in the applications.
In eCos this has been designed to be located at a consistent address
for each CPU model (V850/SA1 or V850/SB1). It
may be determined from an eCos executable using the following command
at a cygwin bash prompt:</PARA>
<PARA><PROGRAMLISTING>v850-elf-nm EXECUTABLE | grep hal_v85x_ice_syscall_info</PROGRAMLISTING></PARA>
<PARA>At the current time, this address is 0xfc0400 for a Cosmo
board fitted with a V850/SA1, or 0xfc0540 for a Cosmo board
fitted with a V850/SB1.</PARA>
<PARA>So for example, the GDB command for the SB1 would be:</PARA>
<PARA><PROGRAMLISTING>(gdb) monitor syscallinfo 0xfc0540</PROGRAMLISTING></PARA>
<PARA>Given that the syscallinfo address is fixed over all eCos
executables for a given target, it is possible to define it on the
libremote command line as well using the "-t" option, for example:</PARA>
<PARA><PROGRAMLISTING>bash$ v850ice -t 0xfc0400

<TITLE>Test Suites</TITLE>
<PARA>The eCos kernel and other packages have test suites which
rigorously exercise the available features and confirm correct execution.
The tests are run on many different possible configurations, but
the high number of configuration permutations makes it impossible
to test them all. The use of test suites is particularly important
for embedded systems, where software robustness is a priority. All
eCos software is tested prior to shipping, but if you define your
own configuration, you will probably want to verify that the test
cases work for it.</PARA>
<PARA>This release includes <!-- <index></index> --> test suites for the eCos
kernel, kernel C API, C library, &micro;ITRON compatibility,
and device driver packages. The use of the test suites is similar
for all packages. The tests are supplied as source code for building
with specific eCos configurations. </PARA>
<PARA>Each test suite consists of a number of test cases which can
be executed individually, as shown below for the TX39, AM31 and
AM33 PowerPC StrongARM SH3, VR4300 SPARClite hardware target, and
all supported ARM platforms, including the Cirrus Logic EP7211 and
EP7212 Development Boards if connecting via a serial line. </PARA>
<PARA>Using the <EMPHASIS>eCos Configuration

<TITLE>The Development Process</TITLE>
<PARA>Most development projects using eCos would contain some (or
most) of  the following:</PARA>
<SECT2>
<TITLE>eCos Configuration</TITLE>
<PARA>eCos is configured to provide the desired API (the inclusion
of libc, uitron, and the disabling of certain undesired funtions,
etc.), and semantics (selecting scheduler, mutex behavior, etc.).
See <XREF LINKEND="CONFIGURING-AND-BUILDING-ECOS-FROM-SOURCE">.</PARA>
<PARA>It would normally make sense to enable eCos assertion checking
at this time as well, to catch as many programming errors during
the development phase as possible.</PARA>
<PARA>Note that it should not be necessary to spend much time on
eCos configuration initially. It may be important to perform fine
tuning to reduce the memory footprint and to improve performance
later when the product reaches a testable state.</PARA>
</SECT2>
<SECT2>
<TITLE>    Integrity check of the eCos configuration</TITLE>
<PARA>While Red Hat strive to thoroughly test eCos, the vast number
of configuration permutations mean that the particular configuration
parameters used for your project may not have been tested. Therefore,
we advise running all the eCos tests after the project's
eCos configuration has been determined. See <XREF LINKEND="TEST-SUITES">.</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, this should be repeated if the configuration changes
later on in the development process.</PARA>
</SECT2>
<SECT2>
<TITLE>    Application Development - Target Neutral Part</TITLE>
<PARA>While your project is probably targeting a specific architecture
and platform, possibly custom hardware, part of the application
development may be possible to perform using simulated or synthetic
targets.</PARA>
<PARA>There are two primary reasons for doing this:</PARA>
<ITEMIZEDLIST>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>It may be possible by this means to perform application
development in parallel with the design/implementation
of the target hardware, thus providing more time for developing
and testing functionality, and reducing time-to-market.</PARA>
</LISTITEM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>The build-run-debug-cycle may be faster when the application
does not have to be downloaded to a target via a serial interface.
Debugging is also likely to be more responsive when you do not have
to to communicate with a stub via serial. It also removes the need
for manually or automatically resetting the target hardware.</PARA>
</LISTITEM>
</ITEMIZEDLIST>
<PARA>This is approach is possible because all targets (including
simulators and synthetic ones) provide the same basic API: that
is, kernel, libc, libm, uitron, infra, and to some extent, HAL and
IO.</PARA>
<PARA>Synthetic targets are especially suitable as they allow you
to jury-rig simulations of elaborate devices by interaction with
the host system, where an IO device API can hide the details from
the application. When switching to hardware later in the development
cycle, the IO driver is properly implemented. While this is possible
to do, and has been done, it is not specifically documented or supported
by Red Hat. It may become so later.</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, select a simulator or synthetic target and use
it for as long as possible doing application development. That is,
configure for the selected target, build eCos, build the application
and link with eCos, run and debug. Repeat the latter two steps.</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, at some time you will have to switch to the intended
target hardware, for example when adding target specific feature
support, for memory footprint/performance characterization,
and for final tuning of eCos and the application.</PARA>
</SECT2>
<SECT2>
<TITLE>    Application Development - Target Specific Part</TITLE>
<PARA>Repeat the build-run-debug-cycle while performing final tuning
and debugging of application. Remember to disable eCos assertion
checking,  as it reduces performance.</PARA>
<PARA>It may be useful to switch between this and the previous step
repeatedly through the development process; use the simulator/synthetic
target for actual development, and use the target hardware to continually
check memory footprint and performance. There should be little cost
in switching between the two targets when using two separate build
trees. </PARA>

<PARA>The eCos kernel and other packages have test suites that rigorously
exercise the available features and confirm correct execution. The
 tests are run on many different possible configurations, but the
high  number of configuration permutations makes it impossible to

for embedded systems, where software robustness is a priority. All
eCos software  is tested prior to shipping, but if you define your
own configuration, you will probably want to verify that the test
cases work for it.</PARA>
<PARA>This release includes test suites for the eCos kernel, kernel
C API, C library, ITRON compatibility, and device driver packages.
The use of the test suites is similar for all packages. The tests

<SECT1 id="testing-filters">
<TITLE>Testing Filters</TITLE>
<PARA>While most test cases today run solely in the target environment,
some packages may require external testing infrastructure and/or
feedback from the external environment to do complete testing.</PARA>
<PARA>The serial package is an example of this. It is the first
package to require external testing infrastructure, but it will
certainly not be the last.</PARA>
<PARA>Since the serial line is also used for communication with
GDB, a  filter is inserted in the communication pathway between
GDB and the serial device which is connected to the hardware target.
The filter forwards all communication between the two, but also
listens for special commands embedded in the data stream from the
target.</PARA>
<PARA>When such a command is seen, the filter stops forwarding data
to GDB  from the target and enters a special mode. In this mode
the test case running on the target is able to control the filter,
commanding it to run various tests. While these tests run, GDB is
isolated from the target.</PARA>
<PARA>As the test completes (or if the filter detects a target crash)
the communication path between GDB and the hardware target is re-established,
allowing GDB to resume control.</PARA>
<PARA>In theory, it is possible to extend the filter to provide
a generic framework for other target-external testing components,
thus decoupling the testing infrastructure from the (possibly limited)
communication means provided by the target (serial, JTAG, Ethernet,
etc). </PARA>
<PARA>Another advantage is that the host tools will not need to
know about the various testing environments required by the eCos
packages, since all contact with the target will continue to happen
via GDB.</PARA>
<PARA>It remains to be seen if it will be possible, or sensible,
to implement all target-external testing infrastructure via filters.</PARA>

the C library standard I/O (by default) is configured not
to be thread-safe, which means that if more than one thread is using
standard I/O they might corrupt each other. This is fixed
by a mutual exclusion (or <EMPHASIS>mutex</EMPHASIS>) lockout mechanism: the threads
do not call printf() until cyg_mutex_lock()
has returned, which only happens when the other thread calls cyg_mutex_unlock().</PARA>
<PARA>You could avoid using the mutex by configuring the C library
to be thread-safe (by selecting the component <LITERAL>CYGSEM_LIBC_STDIO_THREAD_SAFE_STREAMS</LITERAL>).
Keep in mind that if the C library is thread-safe, you can no longer
use printf() in cyg_user_start(). </PARA>

<PARA>If a program wanted to execute a task at a given time, or
periodically, it could do it in an inefficient way by sitting in
an infinite loop and checking the real-time clock to see if the
proper amount of time has elapsed. But operating systems usually provide
system calls which allow the program to be interrupted at the desired
time.</PARA>
<PARA>eCos provides a rich timekeeping formalism, involving <EMPHASIS>counters</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS>clocks</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS>alarms</EMPHASIS>, and <EMPHASIS>timers</EMPHASIS>.
The precise definition, relationship, and motivation of these features
is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but these examples illustrate
how to set up basic periodic tasks.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS><!-- <index></index> -->Alarms are events that happen at
a given time, either once or periodically. A thread associates an
alarm handling function with the alarm, so that the function will
be invoked every time the alarm &ldquo;goes off</EMPHASIS>&rdquo;.</PARA>

<PARA>When running in a simulator the <!-- <index></index> -->
delays might be quite long. On a hardware board (where the clock
speed is 100 ticks/second) the delays should average to
about 0.3 seconds (and 2 seconds between alarms). In simulation,
the delay will depend on the speed of the processor and will almost
always be much slower than the actual board. You might want to reduce
the delay parameter when running in simulation.</PARA>
</NOTE>
<PARA>Here are a few things you might notice about this program:</PARA>
<ITEMIZEDLIST>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>It used the cyg_real_time_clock();
this always returns a handle to the default system real-time <!-- <index></index> -->
clock. </PARA>
</LISTITEM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA><!-- <index></index> -->Alarms are based on <!-- <index></index> -->
counters, so the function cyg_alarm_create() uses
a counter handle. The program used the function cyg_clock_to_counter()
to strip the clock handle to the underlying counter handle. </PARA>
</LISTITEM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>Once the alarm is created it is <!-- <index></index> -->
initialized with cyg_alarm_initialize(), which
sets the time at which the alarm should go off, as well as the period
for repeating alarms. It is set to go off at the current time and
then to repeat every 200 ticks. </PARA>
</LISTITEM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>The alarm handler function test_alarm_func()
conforms to the guidelines for writing alarm handlers and other <!-- <index></index> --><!-- <index></index> -->
delayed service routines:
it does not invoke any functions which might lock the scheduler.
This is discussed in detail in the <CITETITLE>eCos Reference Manual</CITETITLE>, in the chapter Requirements for programs.</PARA>
</LISTITEM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>There is a <EMPHASIS>critical region</EMPHASIS> in this
program: the variable <LITERAL>how_many_alarms</LITERAL> is accessed
in the main thread of control and is also modified in the alarm
handler. To prevent a possible (though unlikely) race condition
on this variable, access to <LITERAL>how_many_alarms</LITERAL> in
the principal thread is protected by calls to <FUNCTION>cyg_scheduler_lock()</FUNCTION>
and <FUNCTION>cyg_scheduler_unlock()</FUNCTION>. When the scheduler
is locked, the alarm handler will not be invoked, so the problem
is averted. </PARA>

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) &lt;year>  &lt;name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  &lt;signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

      <TITLE>The eCos Copyright Assignment Form</TITLE>
      <section>
        <title>Rationale</title>

        <para>This preamble describes how to use the standard eCos copyright assignment
form. The rationale behind this assignment is to avoid any possible confusion
over the legal ownership of eCos, and to indemnify Red Hat and all eCos users
against copyright or patent claims on contributed code used within eCos.
Red Hat would be especially vulnerable, but all users and their eCos based
applications could be affected.</para>
        
        <para>In virtually all cases, all contributions to eCos for which there are
copyright assignments will be made available publically covered by the
<link linkend="GNU-GENERAL-PUBLIC-LICENSE">GNU General Public License</link>
plus an exception permitting linking eCos with proprietary code in order to make
the license more appropriate for embedded systems. The license provides a
guarantee that the contribution will remain freely available to all.</para>

        <para>This agreement gives Red Hat ownership of your changes but promises that
you will retain the right to use your contributed changes as you see fit. For convenience,
signing this agreement allows you to make further changes and additions and contribute
them as well if you so desire, without the necessity of signing a separate agreement.
There is however no requirement for you to do so.
</para>
        
        <para>Because employers often can claim ownership over things that employees
write, you may also have to get your employer to sign a disclaimer that says that
they have no claim to the changes you are contributing.</para>

        <para>Please read everything, and if you have any questions, email
<email>ecos-assign@redhat.com</email> for help.</para>

      <section id="how-to-assign-copyright">
        <title>How to assign copyright</title>

        <para>The way to assign copyright to Red Hat is to sign an assignment contract. This is 
what makes Red Hat the legal copyright holder, so that Red Hat can register the 
copyright on the new version. </para>

        <para>If you are employed as a programmer (even at a university), or have made an 
agreement with your employer or school that gives them ownership of the software 
you write, then Red Hat needs a signed letter from your employer disclaiming 
rights to the contributed software. </para>

        <para>The disclaimer should be printed on the company's headed paper, and signed by an 
officer of the company, or someone authorized to license the company's 
intellectual property. Here is an example of wording that can be used for this 
purpose:
<blockquote>
            <para><replaceable>&lt;INSERT COMPANY NAME&gt;</replaceable> hereby disclaims all copyright
interest in the changes and enhancements made by <replaceable>&lt;INSERT YOUR NAME&gt;</replaceable> to eCos,
including any future revisions of these changes and enhancements.</para>
        
            <para><replaceable>&lt;INSERT COMPANY NAME&gt;</replaceable> affirms that it has no other intellectual
property interest that would undermine this release, or the use of eCos, and will do nothing 
to undermine it in the future.</para>
        
        <para><replaceable>&lt;INSERT SIGNATURE OF OFFICER OF COMPANY&gt;</replaceable></para>
	<para><replaceable>&lt;INSERT DATE&gt;</replaceable></para>
        <para><replaceable>&lt;INSERT PRINTED NAME OF OFFICER OF COMPANY&gt;</replaceable></para>
        <para><replaceable>&lt;INSERT TITLE OF OFFICER&gt;</replaceable></para>
          </blockquote></para>

        <para>If your employer says they do have an intellectual property claim that could 
conflict with the use of the program, then please contact Red Hat to discuss 
possible next steps.</para>
        
        <para>Below is the usual assignment contract. You need to edit and replace

eCos ASSIGNMENT

For good and valuable consideration, receipt of which I acknowledge, I,  
<replaceable>INSERT NAME OF CONTRIBUTOR</replaceable>, hereby transfer to Red Hat, Inc.
my entire right, title, and interest (including all rights under
copyright) in my changes and enhancements to the eCos Operating System and
associated software (herein called the "Software"), subject to the conditions
below. These changes and enhancements are herein called the "Work". The Work
also includes any future changes and enhancements to the Software hereafter
made by me which I also hereby assign.

Upon thirty days prior written notice, Red Hat agrees to grant me  non-
exclusive rights to use the Work (i.e. just my changes and enhancements,  
not eCos as a whole) as I see fit; (and Red Hat's rights shall otherwise  
continue unchanged).

I hereby agree that if I have or acquire hereafter any patent or interface  
copyright or other intellectual property interest dominating the software  
enhanced by the Work (or use of that software), such dominating interest 
will not be used to undermine the effect of this assignment, i.e. Red Hat 
and the  general public will be licensed to use, in that program and its 
derivative works, without royalty or limitation, the subject matter of the 
dominating interest. This license provision will be binding on my heirs, 
assignees, or  other successors to the dominating interest, as well as on 
me.

I hereby represent and warrant that I am the sole copyright holder for the  
Work and that I have the right and power to enter into this contract. I 
hereby  indemnify and hold harmless Red Hat, its officers, employees, and 
agents  against any and all claims, actions or damages (including 
attorney's  reasonable fees) asserted by or paid to any party on account of 
a breach or  alleged breach of the foregoing warranty. I make no other 
express or implied  warranty (including without limitation, in this 
disclaimer of warranty, any  warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE).

Agreed:
