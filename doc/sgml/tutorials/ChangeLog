	* ecos-tutorial.sgml: Expanded "i386 PC Hardware Setup" section to
	include information about FLOPPY and GRUB booting, and to add a
	section about debugging standalone applications.

2002-10-15  Iztok Zupet <iz@vsr.si>

	* ecos-tutorial.sgml: pictures (gif==>png)
	* pix/*.png: generated from gifs with gimp

	* .cvsignore: Ignore the generated html files.

2002-05-20  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* ecos-tutorial.sgml: RHEPL -> GPL. A few minor other tweaks, but
	resisted fixing more.

2002-03-11  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* ecos-tutorial.sgml: Document Cirrus/Maverick EP7312 at all, as
	part of adding notes about the 90MHz option that some boards have.

2002-02-14  Julian Smart <julians@redhat.com>

	* ecos-tutorial.sgml: Added some spacing, created new GIFs for
	Configuration Tool, altered text to reflect presence of tool
	on both platforms.

2002-02-05  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* ecos-tutorial.sgml: add id tags to all sect1 stuff.

2002-01-06  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@galassi.org>

	* ecos-tutorial.sgml: more corrections based on a visual scan
	through the document.  Looks good.

2002-01-05  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@galassi.org>

	* ecos-tutorial.sgml: shortened an id attribute so that
	docbook2html does not complain on redhat.

	* ecos-tutorial.sgml: finished adding all the conditional text,
	and it validates.  Things remaining to be done: (1) visual-check
	HTML for new stuff, (2) normalize it.

2002-01-04  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@galassi.org>

	* ecos-tutorial.sgml: put in a lot more of the conditional text.
	Some is still missing.  Also restored some conditional figures.

	* ecos-tutorial.sgml: put in more conditional text, up to the
	package description.

	* ecos-tutorial.sgml: added the class="monospaced" attribute to
	the <literallayout> tags for the real time characterization
	appendices.

	* ecos-tutorial.sgml: restored a bunch of the conditional text.
	There is probably still some more.

2001-12-22  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* ecos-tutorial.sgml: Move all pictures to pix/ subdirectory.
	Fix copyright year format.
	Give every chapter/part an ID. And some sect1's (not finished).
	A few other tagging fixes.

2001-12-17  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@galassi.org>

	* ecos-tutorial.sgml: renormalized.  since this can be tricky I
	tagged this directory before committing with the tag
	"before-new-normalization".

	* ecos-tutorial.sgml: yay: imported all the missing hardware setup
	sections from the FrameMaker docs.  This somehow had gotten lost
	the first time.

	* ecos-tutorial.sgml: little typo fix in the copyright notice.

	* ecos-tutorial.sgml: added legal stuff and contact information.

2001-12-16  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@galassi.org>

	* ecos-tutorial.sgml: added some preface material ("contact Red
	Hat" and legal stuff) that Jonathan sent.

	* ecos-tutorial.sgml: put titles on all the board-specific real
	time characterization appendices.

2001-12-10  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@galassi.org>

	* ecos-tutorial.sgml: reintroduced the appendices.  They need more
	work from me.

2001-11-28  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* ecos-tutorial.sgml: Get it to verify.

2001-11-21  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@galassi.org>

	* foreword.sgml: new file with Paul Beskeen's foreword.

	* ecos-tutorial.sgml: added the documentation roadmap chapter and
	added inclusion of foreword.sgml.

	* ecos-tutorial.sgml: took care of all the <programlisting> and
	cross-reference issues.  This is mostly complete now.

2001-11-20  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@galassi.org>

	* ecos-tutorial.sgml: lots more work to clean it up, including
	reinstating the table.

2001-11-16  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@galassi.org>

	* ecos-tutorial-not-normalized.sgml: this is the one I was editing
	before.  It is now deprecated.

	* ecos-tutorial.sgml: now this is the new normalized document
	produced with:

sgmlnorm -d -m -n ecos-tutorial-not-normalized.sgml > ecos-tutorial.sgml

	* ecos-tutorial.sgml (monitor): have done a lot of the fixup.

2001-10-29  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@galassi.org>

	* replaced graphic11.cgm with graphic11.cgm.bz2 which is *way*
	smaller.
