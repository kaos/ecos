		eCos Host-side Software
		=======================

This directory contains the eCos host-side sources. This includes
libcdl, the CDL library which underlies the whole eCos configuration
system, and both the command-line and graphical configuration tools.

The eCos host-side software is free software, released under the GNU
General Public License. See the file COPYING for further details.


Contents
========

The host-side sources include the following:

infra/
    This is an implementation of the eCos infrastructure that can be
    used on the host-side, and provides assertion, tracing and
    testcase support.

    NOTE: the eCos infrastructure facilities are not especially
    well-suited to host-side development, in particular they are not
    C++-oriented. There are plans to remove the current infrastructure
    completely and replace it with something more suitable. People
    planning new projects should be aware of this, and may wish to
    avoid using the current infrastructure.

libcdl/
    The CDL library lies at the heart of the eCos configuration system.    

tools/configtool/
    The sources to the various configuration tools can be found here.
    In particular the command line ecosconfig tool lives in
    tools/configtool/standalone/common; the sources related to
    makefile generation currently live in
    tools/configtool/common/common, and the graphical configuration
    tool is spread over various directories including
    tools/configtool/common/win32 and tools/configtool/standalone/win32

There are various other sub-directories related to the admin tool,
testing support, and so on.

It should be noted that the eCos host-side software is still
undergoing rapid development, and the sources are subject to change
and reorganization at any time.    

Much of the code is cross-platform. The obvious exception is the
graphical configuration tool which, at the time of writing, can only
be built for Windows hosts and requires Visual C++. It should be
possible to build the underlying libraries and the command-line
configuration tool using gcc/g++ on any Unix platform. A Unix version
of the graphical configuration tool is planned but not yet available.

More Information
================

Please see the eCos web site, http://sourceware.cygnus.com/ecos/, for
further details. This includes the FAQ, a form for reporting problems,
and details of the various mailing lists
(http://sourceware.cygnus.com/ecos/intouch.html)
At the time of writing there are no separate mailing lists for the
eCos host-side sources, the main mailing list
ecos-discuss@sourceware.cygnus.com should be used instead.


Installation
============

Test builds of the eCos host-side generally happen on the following
platforms: Red Hat Linux 6.1 and later; Windows NT using cygwin 1.0 or
later; and Windows NT using VC++ 6.0. The graphical configuration tool
can only be built with VC++ and involves a Developer Studio project,
see tools/configtool/standalone/win32/Configtool.dsw. The other
software can be built using the conventional "configure/make/make
install" steps. It should be noted that the eCos host-side software is
not fully auto-confiscated, and some facilities like "make dist" will
not work. Also, the existing DejaGnu-based testing facilities are
minimal, only intended as a starting point, and may not work on all
platforms.

The eCos host-side software has a dependency on Tcl. This is not
supplied with the sources, because many users will already have a
suitable installation. Any release of Tcl from 8.0 onwards should be
usable. There are some configure command-line options related to the
Tcl installation, as described below.

The instructions for installing under Linux are given first.
Installation on other platforms is very similar, so only the
differences will be noted.

Installing on Linux
===================

It is strongly recommended that a separate build tree is used, as
opposed to building directly in the source tree. The latter has not
been tested and, given some of the build steps, may not work very
well.

  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build

The next step is to run the toplevel configure script. It might be
possible to configure and build individual directories within the
host-side hierarchy, but again this has not been tested.

  $ <path>/configure <args>

A list of the all the command-line options can be obtained by running
"configure --help". The most important ones are as follows:

1) --prefix. This can be used to specify the location of the install
   tree, defaulting to /usr/local, so the ecosconfig program ends up
   in /usr/local/bin/ecosconfig and the CDL library ends up in
   /usr/local/lib/libcdl.a. If an alternative location is preferred
   this can be specified with --prefix, for example:

   $ <path>/configure --prefix=/usr/local/ecos <args>

2) --enable-debug. By default all assertions and tracing are disabled.
   When debugging any of the host-side software these must be enabled.

   $ <path>/configure --enable-debug

   It is also possible to control most of the assertion and tracing
   macros at a finer grain. This is likely to be useful only to the
   main developers:

   --disable-asserts        disable all assertions
   --disable-preconditions  disable a subset of the assertions
   --disable-postconditions disable a subset of the assertions
   --disable-invariants     disable a subset of the assertions
   --disable-loopinvariants disable a subset of the assertions
   --disable-tracing        disable tracing
   --disable-fntracing      disable function entry/exit tracing

3) --with-tcl=<path> and --with-tcl-version=<number>
   The host-side tools have a dependency on Tcl, which is not supplied
   with the sources because many people will already have a suitable
   installation. Specifically it is necessary to have the header file
   tcl.h and appropriate libraries such that -ltcl will work - this
   can involve either static or shared libraries.

   By default the configure script will assume that there is a
   suitable Tcl installation in the install location, so if there is
   no --prefix argument then it will look for /usr/local/include/tcl.h
   and it will add -L/usr/local/lib to the library search path. If
   Tcl is installed elsewhere then this can be specified with a
   --with-tcl option. For example, if the default installation in
   /usr should be used then the following configure option is
   appropriate:

   $ <path>/configure --with-tcl=/usr <args>

   It is possible to have multiple versions of Tcl installed, for
   example libtcl8.0.a, libtcl8.1.a, and so on. Typically linking with
   -ltcl will result in the latest version being used. It is possible
   to specify a different version using --with-tcl-version, e.g.:

   $ <path>configure --with-tcl=/usr/local/scriptics --with-tcl-version=8.1 <args>

Following the configure step the build tree should be set up
correctly. All that remains is the actual build and install:

   $ make
   $ make install

This should result in an ecosconfig executable, plus appropriate
libraries and header files.   
   

Installing on cygwin
====================

Installing under cygwin requires essentially the same steps as
under Linux. It is more likely that a suitable --prefix option will
have to be used, and that the location of the Tcl installation needs
to be specified with --with-tcl. However appropriate use of cygwin
mount points may avoid some of these problems. If the full path to
the configure script contains spaces, then the short form of the path
should be used when invoking configure.

One issue to be aware of is the naming convention for the Tcl library.
On a Unix system this will typically be called libtcl8.0.a (adjusted
according to the version number), with a symbolic link from libtcl.a
to the most recent version. Under cygwin the equivalent library is
called libtcl80.a, and symbolic links are not used. For a standard
cygwin 1.0 installation the configure script knows how to pick up the
appropriate library, but if a more recent version of Tcl has been
installed then due care has to be taken with the --with-tcl-version
option. 


Installing on NT with VC++
==========================

It is possible to build both the graphical configuration tool and the
ecosconfig command line tool using a Developer Studio project,
tools/ecosconfig/standalone/win32/Configtool.dsw

It is also possible to build the command line tool and the various
libraries using the configure script. At the time of writing the
graphical configuration tool cannot yet be built that way. This still
requires a cygwin installation because it needs the bash shell and GNU
make. First, it is necessary to tell the configure script to use a
compiler other than gcc:

  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ CC=cl CXX=cl <path>/configure <args>

The configure script will do the right thing if VC++ is specified in
this way.

It is likely that /usr/local will be an inappropriate install location
for VC++ applications, so an alternative prefix needs to be specified:

  $ CC=cl CXX=cl <path>/configure --prefix=<install-path> <args>

Note that the install path should be a cygwin path, i.e. cygwin mount
points are accepted and forward slashes should be used.
  
It is also necessary to use the right version of Tcl. For a VC++ build
the cygwin release of Tcl should not be used. Instead a suitable
prebuilt Tcl package can be obtained from http://www.scriptics.com/.
It is necessary to tell the configure script where this has been
installed, for example:

  $ CC=cl CXX=cl <path>/configure --prefix=<install-path> \
    --with-tcl=/d/local/scriptics/Tcl/tcl8.1 <args>

The library name will be of the form tcl81.lib, and there will not be
a symbolic link from tcl.lib to the appropriate version. Typically it
will be necessary to specify the Tcl version explicitly:    

  $ CC=cl CXX=cl <path>/configure --prefix=<install-path> \
    --with-tcl=/d/local/scriptics/Tcl/tcl8.1 --with-tcl-version=81 <args>

Following a successful configure, the tools can be built and installed
in the normal fashion:

  $ make
  $ make install

This assumes that the cl.exe executable is on the shell's search path,
and that appropriate environment variables such as INCLUDE and LIB are
set up correctly. The VC++ documentation should be consulted for
further information.
