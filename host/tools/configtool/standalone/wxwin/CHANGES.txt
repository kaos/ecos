Release History for eCos Configuration Tool 2
=============================================


*** Version 2.04, July 16th 2001

- Now uses /cygdrive/ notation which is future-proof for newer Cygwins,
  and works around a mkdir bug in older Cygwins. A side-effect of this
  is that we no longer mount drives from the tool, so we don't get the
  flashing DOS box under Windows. Makefiles now define HOST=CYGWIN
  so that makefiles can use mkdir the right way under Windows.


*** Version 2.03, July 9nd 2001

- Corrected a bug introduced in the previous release, where the initial template
  selection was wrong.

- More forgiving when specifying the packages directory for the repository.

- Run Tests dialog now working when using a serial port: Windows and Linux. TCP/IP
  mode seems to be working on Windows also.

- Now saves file history list in FileHistory instead of top-level in config file/registry.

- Removed Server-side GDB checkbox in platform editor.

- Widened TCP/IP port text control in Run Tests settings dialog.

- Fixed bug where message box with an empty repository name was shown if no repository
  was found at all.

- Fixed long-term Configuration Tool bug where some conflicts weren't resolved properly
  (bool-data options).

- Added vertical scrollbar to Short Description window.


*** Version 2.02, June 27th 2001

- Packages are now sorted in the Packages Dialog.
  Templates are sorted on Windows, not yet on Linux.

- There was an interaction between Configtool/TCL/Windows 98 that
  caused a GPF when saving files. This has now been worked around.

- When entering the user tools directory, Configtool now
  recognises it correctly if it contains appropriate binaries.

- The current build tools path is saved so that if the eCos
  installer wasn't used, there will be a default build tools
  path and the user won't get asked every time.

- Main window now refreshed after some dialogs close and before
  a lengthy operation for aesthetic reasons.

- The dialogs for saving and opening .ecc files now default to the
  directory of the last loaded/saved file, for convenience.

- Switched to Rich Edit control for Output Window since it has
  a higher capacity; this causes scrolling behaviour to be
  less than optimal on NT and a bit weird on Win98, so there's some
  work to do.

- Stopping a build now works.

- Added CHANGES.txt and TODO.txt to the distribution.


*** Version 2.01, June 2001

- Clicking Save when tool was first loaded didn't do anything.
  Now behaves like Save As for a first-time save.

- Mix-up with directory names fixed.

- Windows installer now leaves existing DLLs intact even if
  the installer's files were newer.

- The Unix tarball now contains a subdirectory containing the current
  version in the name.


*** Version 2.0, May 2001

- Initial public release
