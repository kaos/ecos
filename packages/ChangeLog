	* pkgconf.tcl:
	Add new #define's for the target and platform headers.

1999-04-30  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* pkgconf.tcl:
	Fixed the command line used when generating extras.o (again)

1999-04-28  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* pkgconf/makevars:

1999-04-16  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* pkgconf.tcl:
	Remove the phony target "packages". This is no longer useful and
	was causing problems, extras.o was not always rebuilt when it
	should because of a dependency on a phony target.
	
	* pkgconf.tcl:
	Simplify the rules for extras.o, based on the assumption that
	libextras.a will always exist. This is now guaranteed via
	hal/common/src/dummy.c

	* packages: Remove the hardware attribute from the WALLCLOCK
	and WATCHDOG packages.
	* targets: Remove the dependency of each platform on the
	WALLCLOCK and WATCHDOG packages since these are no longer
        hardware packages.

1999-03-05  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* targets: Remove old DEVICES package requirements.
	Add WALLCLOCK, WATCHDOG for all platforms.

1999-03-04  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	These changes merged from 'ecos-new_devs-19990216-branch'

	(1999-02-18  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>)

	Under Windows the external cygpath utility is now used to
	perform pathname translations. This eliminates the need for
	pkgconf.tcl to know about or make guesses about the mount
	table.

	* pkgrelease.tcl:
	Added NEWS to the list of special files.

1999-03-04  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

1999-03-02  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* pkgconf.tcl:
	tclsh 8.0 patchlevel 0 had problems accessing a namespace
	array variable when a command was running inside a safe
	interpreter. Prefixing the array variable with :: avoids
	the problem and is still legal Tcl code.

1999-02-26  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* targets (sleb): 
	* packages (CYGPKG_HAL_SPARCLITE_SLEB):

	Add a check for versions of Tcl older than 8.0, and produce
	a sensible error message in those cases.

Thu Oct 15 08:55:00 1998  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* customers:
	Fix typo in prebuilts for `public' customer.

Wed Oct 14 15:50:34 1998  Tim Goodwin  <tgoodwin@cygnus.co.uk>

	* customers:

Tue Oct 13 17:10:46 1998  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* targets: 
	Add -Wl,-static to link flags, since the up-and-coming
	toolchains after 1.1 will require it. In particular anyone
	using the latest devo compilers needs it.

Tue Oct 13 14:52:50 1998  Tim Goodwin  <tgoodwin@cygnus.co.uk>

	* pkgconf.tcl:
	Fix missing package name that causes bogus error message.

1998-10-12  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* targets: added -ffunction-sections and -fdata-sections for
	powerpc.

Mon Oct 12 18:52:35 1998  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* targets:

	For PR 17319

1998-10-08  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@penang.cygnus.co.uk>

	* packages: 
	* targets: 
	Add support for new architecture.

1998-10-06  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

      * customers:
      Make the PowerPC architecture part of the public release.

1998-09-25  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* pkgconf.tcl:
	PR 17485: as a temporary workaround header files in the install
	tree are now always deleted. This is a sub-optimal solution since
	it may cause unnecessary rebuilds of the system and of application
	code, but it is safe. A correct solution would require much more
	work. 

1998-09-18  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* pkgconf.tcl: The argument parsing code no longer tries to be
	clever when parsing pathnames. Any string is accepted, and if the
	filename happens to be illegal then this should result in a
	reasonable error message when generating the build tree.

Thu Sep 17 17:33:44 1998  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* targets: TX39 doesn't support GDB_DEVICE.

Tue Sep 15 19:38:55 1998  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* targets: 
	Removed -Winline for tx39 target since this toolchain produces
	warnings specific to it about not being able to inline functions
	that return something more than 32 bits.	

Tue Sep 15 19:11:20 1998  David Moore  <dsm@keema.cygnus.co.uk>

	* pkgconf.tcl: Cleaned up comments.

Tue Sep 15 13:49:06 1998  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* targets: Cleaned up powerpc lines.

1998-09-14  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* pkgconf.tcl:
	Fixes for PR 17286. After the earlier fixes for PR 17195 pkgconf
	had started deleting the makefile.deps files even when it was
	not always appropriate to do so. Now makefile.deps files only
	get deleted if there has been a change to the configuration's
	set of packages. Whenever there is such a change the file
	pkgconf/pkgconf.mak gets updated, which should cause everything
	to be rebuilt and new makefile.deps files to be generated.

1998-09-11  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* packages:
	Added more useful aliases for the watchdog and wallclock devices.

	* pkgconf.tcl:
	Fixes for PR 17195.
	When it becomes necessary to clean out the build tree,
	the generated makefile.deps files are now removed as well.
	It was possible for these files to reference headers that
	are no longer in the configuration.
	When a package was disabled and then re-enabled, the
	generated makefiles for the include directories would believe
	incorrectly that the install/include directory was up to date
	because of .stamp files. These generated makefiles no longer
	rely on .stamp files for correct operation to avoid any
	such problems.

	* targets:
	All individual device drivers are now disabled when using
	the simulator HAL packages.

1998-09-08  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* pkgconf.tcl (pkgconf::produce_misc_files): 
	* pkgconf/makrules.prv: 
	* pkgconf/makrules.tst: 
	* pkgconf/makrules.src:
	Allow per-package make rules, for use by configuration tool.

Tue Sep  8 14:40:57 1998  Tim Goodwin  <tgoodwin@cygnus.co.uk>

        * targets:
        Turn on selective linking for TX39.  Remove `-fno-builtin'.

Mon Sep  7 18:24:07 1998  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* targets: 
	Add -finit-priority to mn10300 and tx39 for it is no longer the
	default, with our latest lovely tools.

1998-09-04  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* pkgconf.tcl: pkgconf::get_current_packages { }
	Hardware packages which were inappropriate for the current target
	but still explicitly enabled by the user were being ignored. In
	such cases the user should be able to override the settings.

	<pkgconf/system.h> now contains #undef's for packages that are not
	present. 

1998-09-03  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* targets:
	The tx39 simulator platform should not have the serial device
	enabled. 

	* pkgconf.tcl:
	Changed the output of --pkgdata to match the needs of the
	configuration tool.

Thu Sep  3 15:13:42 1998  Tim Goodwin  <tgoodiwn@cygnus.co.uk>

	* packages:

	s/panx/mn10300/g

1998-09-03  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* pkgrelease.tcl:
	Updated to cope with the HAL packages no longer being special.
	Also tidied up some of the Tcl code and removed a few references
	to ecc.

1998-09-02  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* packages:
	Changed a few aliases, to improve consistency.

	* pkgconf.tcl: 
	Added Windows-specific support for pathnames with spaces.
	
	* pkgconf.tcl: 
	* targets: 
	* packages:
	Changed the way HAL packages are handled. At the same time,
	improved the handling of device driver packages.

Wed Sep  2 11:38:58 1998  Tim Goodwin  <tgoodwin@cygnus.co.uk

	* everything: global change to update copyright notice, etc.

Mon Aug 17 22:31:58 1998  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* pkgconf/makrules.tst, pkgconf/makrules.prv: 
	Remove all -ltarget and -lgcc as we now specify them in the HAL
	linker scripts

Thu Aug 13 15:35:16 1998  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* pkgconf/makrules.prv, pkgconf/makrules.tst: 
	Add extra -ltarget as libgcc needs to have symbols resolved from
	the C library

1998-07-31  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* packages: Added watchdog device.

Mon Jul 27 19:36:53 BST 1998  Chris Provenzano  <proven@cygnus.com>
