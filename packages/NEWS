* SH serial driver cleanup. SCIF driver added. SCI and SCIF drivers are
  now separate packages.
* Move logical ethernet "driver" into io/eth where the interface can be shared
  between multiple implementations, e.g. BSD TCP/IP and Red Boot's TCP/IP
  stacks.
* RedBoot - the Red Hat Bootstrap ROM monitor has been added, initially
  supporting ARM-EDB7xxx, ARM-EBSA285, and ARM-Assabet boards. Provides
  serial and ethernet GDB debugging support, flash image management and flash
  booting, BOOTP/DHCP and TFTP boot support and a CLI interface.
* Added PCMCIA and Compact Flash support, including drivers for the ARM-Assabet
  board.
* Added generic FLASH memory support
* Added flash memory support for ARM-EBSA285 and ARM-EDB7xxx boards
* Added Compact Flash Ethernet driver
* Hitachi SH7707a variant support added.
* Support added for both software and hardware flow control with an initial
  version of the latter available only for the ARM PID board at present.
* Loopback serial device driver added
* POSIX termios support added for EL/IX level 1 compatibility
* Improved dynamic memory management support in the memory allocator
  package. Existing dynamic memory support in the kernel (fixed and variable
  block allocators) and in libc (malloc, etc.) has been moved to this
  package, located at services/memalloc/common. It is now possible to support
  memory pools occupying all of remaining memory (as determined by the MLT).
  New memory allocators can be "plugged in", and an example of Doug Lea's
  malloc (dlmalloc) has been included.
* Plug-in filesystem support added, with a POSIX 1003.1 compatible API, found
  in the io/fileio package, and integrated with the C library.
* An initial example filesystem implementation is provided in fs/ram. This
  is a RAM filesystem that attempts to both be a useful tool in its own
  right and an example of how to write a filesystem that plugs into the
  fileio infrastructure.
  The source of the filesystem is in fs/ram/VERSION/src/ramfs.c and is
  intended to be largely self documenting. The General Description at
  the beginning of the file gives an overview of the structure of the
  system, and comments within the code explain specific points. This
  code should be read in conjunction with the description of the fileio
  infrastructure.
* Support added for POSIX 1003.1 threads, mutexes, semaphores, message queues,
  condition variables, clocks, timers and real-time signals in the POSIX
  compatibility package (part of the EL/IX compatibility initiative) found at
  compat/posix.
* Kernel enhanced with Asynchronous Service Routines (ASRs) which are routines
  called back at the point a thread is scheduled.
* Added (configurably) priority ceilings for kernel mutexes
* Support sorted thread queues in kernel, rather than LIFO, controlled by the
  CYGIMP_KERNEL_SCHED_SORTED_QUEUES option.
* The Kernel C API functions cyg_semaphore_wait() and cyg_cond_wait() now
  return booleans to indicate if the wait failed.
* Added enhanced form of kernel message queue which is more flexible at runtime
  than mboxes - available in <cyg/kernel/mqueue.hxx>
* Add a generic interface in <cyg/hal/hal_tables.h> to allow tables of
  data, particularly initialization data, to be included in an application
  image. This replaces the previous __DEVTAB__ and __NETDEVTAB__ references
  in linker scripts.
* Most standard top-level header files now controlled by the "isoinfra"
  package
* C library package split into separate packages on functional boundaries:
  i18n, setjmp, signals, startup, stdio, stdlib, time
* Most targets now implement a standard form of "virtual vectors" - a
  mechanism to allow enhanced co-operation between ROM monitors and running
  applications. This allows the application to leave to the ROM things that
  the ROM supports rather than duplicating, including debug channels that may
  be via serial or ethernet. To take advantage of this, new GDB stub
  images/CygMon images should be programmed onto boards, although old images
  will continue to work - they will just not be able to use the new facilities.
* DHCP support has been added to the TCP/IP support, in addition to the
  existing BOOTP support
* CDL now supports type bool and booldata for interfaces
* CDL now exports extra macros in header files, to indicate package version
  numbers
* A port of the University of California at Davis (UCD) SNMP stack has been
  added
* Hitachi SH7709A variant support added
* NEC V85x architecture support added
* NEC Cosmo CEB-V850/SA1 evaluation board platform HAL added
* Serial device drivers added for systems based on NEC V850 SA1 (70F3017)
  or SB1 (70F3033) processors
* Hitachi SH3 CqREEK (cq7708) platform HAL support added
  Contributed by Haruki Kashiwaya
* Watchdog reworked much like wallclock.
  Common code and API in io/watchdog, simpler (smaller) low-level drivers in
  devs/watchdog/<arch>.
* IO serial driver
  The common serial driver has been extended with a configurable option for
  a non-blocking read/write mode. It has also been given some new callbacks
  which allow low-level drivers to transfer data in blocks instead of as
  single characters.
* SH HAL
  Now provides ROMRAM startup type, copying code and data to RAM before
  executing, improving performance at cost of memory.
* IO serial drivers reworked by separating into distinct platform
  packages, making it simpler to implement new drivers.
* WallClock reworked, making it simpler to implement new drivers.
