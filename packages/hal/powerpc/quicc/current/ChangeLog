	* src/quicc_smc1.c:
	* include/quicc_smc1.h:
	Added ctrlc handling for use via virtual vector table.

2000-03-03  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c: Use common CPM defines (now in ppc8xx.h).

	* include/ppc8xx.h: Add some generic defines for CPM.  Also
	refine ucode area for easier use (someday).

start-serialize-newcdl
2000-02-29  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c (UART_BAUD_RATE): Use CDL option for baud rate.

	* cdl/hal_powerpc_quicc.cdl: Add option to control diag serial
	baud rate, rather than being fixed at 38400.

end-serialize-newcdl
2000-02-21  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c (UART_BIT_RATE): Handle system clock speeds
	which are not integer multiples of MHz, e.g. 33.33 MHz.

2000-02-04  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c (cyg_quicc_smc1_uart_rcvchar): Get frequency
	from new CYGHWR_HAL_POWERPC_BOARD_SPEED variable.

2000-02-03  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c: CYG_HAL_POWERPC_x->CYGPKG_...

1999-09-02  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c (init_smc1_uart): Generalize baud rate computation.

1999-09-01  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/ppc8xx.h: Add some missing definitions (MAR, MBMR).

1999-06-27  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c: Many changes which allow these routines to
	cooperate when the SMC is being used by a serial "driver" as well.
	In particular, remove "hard coded" resources on the SMC.
	Note: there is some lingering problem with the transmit routines
	[globally] after the serial driver re-inits the SMC.  Of course
	this problem is intermittent, so it's hard to fix.

1999-06-24  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c (cyg_hal_gdb_isr): Add this routine to trap ^C
	events and stop the system, if CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_BREAK_SUPPORT.

1999-06-24  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c (cyg_quicc_init_smc1): Remove unused, commented
	out code, that was left over from CygMon version of this file.

1999-06-18  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c (init_smc1_uart): Use default 38400 Baud,
	because it is better.

1999-06-18  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/hal_quicc.h: Fixed CDL description.

1999-06-17  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c (init_smc1_uart): Initialize the baud rate
	depending on the system clock setting.

1999-06-15  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c: Moved include of ppc8xx.h

	* src/ppc8xx.h: Removed, to...

	* include/ppc8xx.h: New file.  Moved here so that platform startup
	code can share it.

1999-06-10  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c: Make this file safe for compilation even when
	no PowerPC 860 is in use; pkgconf can enable this component for
	any target, potentially.

1999-06-10  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* ChangeLog: Component created, based partly on the FADS work and
	on CygMon's serial IO code for the MBX860, to support the Motorola
	MBX860 QUICC serial controller for basic IO.
	Initially only used in the neighbouring platform component
	HAL_POWERPC_MBX [hal/powerpc/mbx/....] 

	* include/quicc_smc1.h
	* include/pkgconf/hal_quicc.h
	* src/PKGconf.mak
	* src/ppc8xx.h
	* src/quicc_smc1.c
	New files.
