>Description</H2
><P
>Usually eCos runs on either a custom piece of hardware, specially
designed to meet the needs of a specific application, or on a
development board of some sort that is available before the final
hardware. Such boards have a number of things in common:
    </P
><P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>Obviously there has to be at least one processor to do the work.
Usually this will be a 32-bit processor, but it can be smaller or
larger. Processor speed will vary widely, depending on the expected
needs of the application. However usually the exact processor being
used does not matter very much for most of the development process:
the use of languages such as C or C++ means that the compiler will
handle those details.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>There needs to be memory for code and for data. A typical system will
have two different types of memory. There will be some non-volatile
memory such as flash, EPROM or masked ROM. There will also be some
volatile memory such as DRAM or SRAM. Often the code for the final
application will reside in the non-volatile memory and all of the RAM
will be available for data. However updating non-volatile memory
requires a non-trivial amount of effort, so for much of the
development process it is more convenient to burn suitable firmware,
for example RedBoot, into the non-volatile memory and then use that to
load the application being debugged into RAM, alongside the
application data and a small area reserved for use by the firmware.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The platform must provide certain mimimal I/O facilities. Most eCos
configurations require a clock signal of some sort. There must also be
some way of outputting diagnostics to the user, often but not always 
via a serial port. Unless special debug hardware is being used, source
level debugging will require bidirectional communication between a
host machine and the target hardware, usually via a serial port or an
ethernet device.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>All the above is not actually very useful yet because there is no way
for the embedded device to interact with the rest of the world, except
by generating diagnostics. Therefore an embedded device will have
additional I/O hardware. This may be fairly standard hardware such as
an ethernet or USB interface, or special hardware designed
specifically for the intended application, or quite often some
combination. Standard hardware such as ethernet or USB may be
supported by eCos device drivers and protocol stacks, whereas the
special hardware will be driven directly by application code.
      </P
></LI
></OL
><P
>Much of the above can be emulated on a typical PC running Linux.
Instead of running the embedded application being developed on a
target board of some sort, it can be run as a Linux process. The
processor will be the PC's own processor, for example an x86, and the
memory will be the process' address space. Some I/O facilities can be
emulated through system calls. For example clock hardware can be
emulated by setting up a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SIGALRM</TT
> signal, which will
cause the process to be interrupted at regular intervals. This
emulation of real hardware will not be particularly accurate, for
example the number of cpu cycles available to the eCos application
between clock ticks will vary widely depending on what else is running
on the PC, but for much development work it will be good enough.
    </P
><P
>A key requirement for synthetic target code is that the embedded
application must not be linked with any of the standard Linux
libraries such as the GNU C library: that would lead to a confusing
situation where both eCos and the Linux libraries attempted to provide
functions such as <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>printf</TT
>. Instead the synthetic
target support must be implemented directly on top of the Linux
kernels' system call interface. For example, the kernel provides a
system call for write operations. The actual function
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>write</TT
> is implemented in the system's C library,
but all it does is move its arguments on to the stack or into certain
registers and then execute a special trap instruction such as
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>int&nbsp;0x80</TT
>. When this instruction is executed
control transfers into the kernel, which will validate the arguments
and perform the appropriate operation. Now, a synthetic target
application cannot be linked with the system's C library. Instead it
contains a function <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_hal_sys_write</TT
> which, like
the C library's <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>write</TT
> function, pushes its
arguments on to the stack and executes the trap instruction. The Linux
kernel cannot tell the difference, so it will perform the I/O
operation requested by the synthetic target. With appropriate
knowledge of what system calls are available, this makes it possible
to emulate the required I/O facilities. For example diagnostic output
can be achieved by a <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_hal_sys_write</TT
> system
call using file descriptor 1, which corresponds to stdout.
    </P
><P
>In many ways developing for the synthetic target is no different from
developing for real embedded targets. eCos must be configured
appropriately: selecting a suitable target such as
<TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>i386linux</B
></TT
> will cause the configuration system
to load the appropriate packages for this hardware; this includes an
architectural HAL package and a platform-specific package; the
architectural package contains generic code applicable to all Linux
platforms, whereas the platform package is for specific Linux
implementations such as the x86 version and contains any
processor-specific code. Selecting this target will also bring in some
device driver packages. Other aspects of the configuration such as
which API's are supported are determined by the template, by adding
and removing packages, and by fine-grained configuration.
    </P
><P
>In other ways developing for the synthetic target can be much easier
than developing for a real embedded target. For example there is no
need to worry about building and installing suitable firmware on the
target hardware, and then downloading and debugging the actual
application over a serial line or a similar connection. Instead an
eCos application built for the synthetic target is mostly
indistinguishable from an ordinary Linux program. It can be run simply
by typing the name of the executable file at a shell prompt.
Alternatively you can debug the application using whichever version of
gdb is provided by your Linux distribution. There is no need to build
or install special toolchains. Essentially using the synthetic target
means that the various problems associated with real embedded hardware
can be bypassed for much of the development process.
    </P
><P
>The eCos synthetic target provides emulation, not simulation. It is
possible to run eCos in suitable architectural simulators but that
involves a rather different approach to software development. For
example, when running eCos on the psim PowerPC simulator you need
appropriate cross-compilation tools that allow you to build PowerPC
executables. These are then loaded into the simulator which interprets
every instruction and attempts to simulate what would happen if the
application were running on real hardware. This involves a lot of
processing overhead, but depending on the functionality provided by
the simulator it can give very accurate results. When developing for
the synthetic target the executable is compiled for the PC's own
processor and will be executed at full speed, with no need for a
simulator or special tools. This will be much faster and somewhat
simpler than using an architectural simulator, but no attempt is made
to accurately match the behaviour of a real embedded target.

>Support for emulating standard hardware such as ethernet is not yet
available in the current release of the eCos synthetic target code,
but is planned for future versions. Emulating application-specific
custom hardware is rather more difficult since there is no way of
knowing just what strange hardware a particular application might
need, but the I/O mechanisms planned should allow for
application-specific extensions.

>Toolchain</H2
><P
>When developing eCos applications for a normal embedded target it is
necessary to use a suitable cross-compiler and related tools such as
the linker. Developing for the synthetic target is easier because you
can just use the standard GNU tools (gcc, g++, ld, &#8230;) which
were provided with your Linux distribution, or which you used to build
your own Linux setup. Any reasonably recent version of the tools, for
example gcc 2.96(Red Hat) as shipped with Red Hat Linux 7, should be
sufficient.
    </P
><P
>There is one important limitation when using these tools: current gdb
will not support debugging of eCos threads on the synthetic target. As
far as gdb is concerned a synthetic target application is also
indistinguishable from a normal Linux application, so it assumes that
any threads will be created by calls to the Linux
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>pthread_create</TT
> function provided by the C
library. Obviously this is not the case since the application is never
linked with that library. Therefore gdb never notices the eCos thread
mechanisms and assumes the application is single-threaded. Fixing this
is possible but would involve non-trivial changes to gdb.
    </P
><P
>Theoretically it is possible to develop synthetic target applications
on, for example, a PC running Windows and then run the resulting
executables on another machine that runs Linux. This is rarely useful:
if a Linux machine is available then usually that machine will also be
used for building ecos and the application. However, if for some
reason it is necessary or desirable to build on another machine then
this requires a suitable cross-compiler and related tools. If the
application will be running on a typical PC with an x86 processor then
a suitable configure triplet would be
<TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>i686-pc-linux-gnu</B
></TT
>. The installation
instructions for the various GNU tools should be consulted for further
information.

>Hardware Preparation</H2
><P
>Preparing a real embedded target for eCos development can be tricky.
Often the first step is to install suitable firmware, usually RedBoot.
This means creating and building a special configuration for eCos with
the RedBoot template, then somehow updating the target's flash chips
with the resulting RedBoot image. Typically it will also be necessary
to get a working serial connection, and possibly set up ethernet as
well. Although usually none of the individual steps are particularly
complicated, there are plenty of ways in which things can go wrong and
it can be hard to figure out what is actually happening. Of course
some board manufacturers make life easier for their developers by
shipping hardware with RedBoot preinstalled, but even then it is still
necessary to set up communication between host and target.
    </P
><P
>None of this is applicable to the synthetic target. Instead you can
just build a normal eCos configuration, link your application with the
resulting libraries, and you end up with an executable that you can
run directly on your Linux machine or via gdb. A useful side effect of
this is that application development can start before any real
embedded hardware is actually available.
    </P
><P
>Typically the memory map for a synthetic target application will be
set up such that there is a read-only ROM region containing all the
code and constant data, and a read-write RAM region for the data. The
default locations and sizes of these regions depend on the specific
platform being used for development. Note that the application always
executes out of ROM: on a real embedded target much of the development
would involve running RedBoot firmware there, with application code
and data loaded into RAM; usually this would change for the final
system; the firmware would be removed; and the application itself
would execute from ROM and perform the appropriate hardware
initialization. Therefore the synthetic target actually emulates the
behaviour of the final system, not the development environment.
