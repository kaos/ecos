2001-07-05  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_intr.h (HAL_RESTORE_INTERRUPTS): Don't change name
	for clobbers.

2001-07-04  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_intr.h: Be pedantic about register constraint syntax
	to satisfy newer compilers
	* include/hal_io.h: Ditto

2001-06-13  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_i386.cdl: Default to enabling FPU support since gcc assumes
	a hardware FPU anyway. Also default to lazy FPU switching since
	this is cheapest in the modal case.

2001-05-01  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	[x86 branch]	
	* src/context.S: Fixed bug in hal_setjmp() that corrupted EBX.

2001-04-26  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	[x86 branch]
	* include/hal_intr.h:
	Tidied up mapping of exceptions to vectors. Added implementation
	of HAL_VSR_SET_TO_ECOS_HANDLER().

2001-04-19  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	[x86 branch]
	* src/vectors.S (__default_exception_vsr):
	Disabled ROM monitor stack switching here. There are problems with
	this that I do not have time to worry about now. 

2001-03-30  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	[x86 branch]
	* src/romboot.S: Added code to call video BIOS to initialize
	display.

	* src/vectors.S: Added code to copy data section from ROM to RAM
	in ROM booted systems.

2001-03-16  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	[x86 branch]
	* src/romboot.S:
	* src/romboot.ld:
	Added these files to build 256 byte realmode bootstrap at the top
	of ROM.
	(This is work in progress and is not yet complete.)
	
	* cdl/hal_i386.cdl:
	Added options for building a bootstrap ROM.
	(This is work in progress and is not yet complete.)
	
	* include/basetype.h:
	Returned alignment to 32 bytes, now that I have discovered, the
	hard way, why it was that value in the first place.

	* src/i386.ld: Force alignment of tables to 32 bytes.

	* include/hal_arch.h (HAL_THREAD_INIT_FPU_CONTEXT_SPACE): Fixed
	compiler warning.

2001-03-14  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	[x86 branch]
	* src/vectors.S:
	Removed memory size stuff.
	Moved BSS zero code here to avoid doing a procedure call. The
	interrupt stack is in the BSS so zeroing it would blow the return
	address away.
	Moved interrupt stack to BSS.

	* src/hal_misc.c: Removed hal_zero_bss(), hal_lsbit_index() and
	hal_msbit_index() functions.

	* include/hal_arch.h:
	Replaced hal_[lm]sbit_index() functions with inline assembler
	using the bsf and bsr instructions.
	Added support for dynamic memory size finder.	

	* cdl/hal_i386.cdl:
	Added interface CYGINT_HAL_I386_MEM_REAL_REGION_TOP.

2001-03-13  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	[x86 branch]
	* src/vectors.S: Enabled FPU support.
	Added FPU state save and restore macros to default exception and
	interrupt VSRs.
	Added __fpu_switch_vsr to perform lazy context switch of FPU
	state.
	Made use of i386reg_xxx definitions.

	* src/context.S: Added FPU save and restore macros to thread
	switch code. Made use of i386reg_xxx definitions.

	* include/hal_arch.h: Added HAL_FPU_Context structure to contain
	FPU state. Added code to HAL_THREAD_INIT_CONTEXT() to create
	FPU context.

	* include/i386.inc: Updated savestate format in line with hal_arch.h

	* include/arch.inc: Added macros to implement FPU initialization,
	save and restore for threads, exceptions and interrupts.

	* cdl/hal_i386.cdl: Added initial FPU configuration options.

2001-03-09  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	[x86 branch]
	* src/vectors.S:
	Added support for use of interrupt stack, together with support
	for running DSRs on it.
	Added instrumentation support to default interrupt VSR.
	Miscellaneous tidies to code and comments.

	* src/context.S:
	Rewrote context switch code to permit preservation of the
	interrupt disable state of a thread. This is to support use of an
	interrupt stack, calling DSRs on it and brings the i386 HAL in
	line with other HALs.

	* include/hal_intr.h:
	Added HAL_INTERRUPT_STACK_CALL_PENDING_DSRS(),
	HAL_INTERRUPT_STACK_BASE and HAL_INTERRUPT_STACK_TOP.

	* include/i386.inc: 
	* include/hal_arch.h:
	* src/i386_stub.c:
	Changed naming of last two HAL_SavedRegisters fields.
	Modified HAL_THREAD_INIT_CONTEXT() to match new context switch
	code.

2001-03-08  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	[x86 branch]
	* src/vectors.S: Eliminated some unnecessary code. Tidied up some
	comments.

	* include/hal_intr.h:
	Moved common exception vector definitions here.
	Moved CPU interrupt enable/disable macros here.
	
	* include/hal_arch.h:
	* src/i386_stub.c: 
	Converted arguments to hal_[g|s]et_gdb_registers() to CYG_ADDRWORD
	from target_register_t.

	* include/arch.inc:
	Moved FPU control stuff here - this still needs a lot of work to
	get running.
	Moved A20 gate enable macro here. Since the A20 gate stuff is part
	of all recent CPUs, this has become an architectural feature.

2001-03-06  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	[x86 branch]	
	* include/hal_arch.h: Added CYGARC_CACHED_ADDRESS() and friends.

2001-03-05  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	[x86 branch]	
	* src/hal_misc.c (hal_arch_default_isr): Restored diag_printf() in
	here. Without the reference, RedBoot does not include anything
	from infra/diag.cxx, does not call HAL_DIAG_INIT() and will not
	mangle diagnostic output. 

2001-03-02  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	[x86 branch]
	Some of these changes here were initially made by Fabrice Gautier
	and then liberally modified by me.
	
	* src/vectors.S:
	Removed Synthetic target support - this is moving to its own HAL.
	Added __default_exception_vsr to capture exceptions.
	Renamed hal_pc_generic_interrupt to __default_interrupt_vsr in
	line with other HALs. Generally tidied and polished.
	Added VSR entry trampolines.
	Added interrupt stack definition.

	* src/i386_stub.c: Removed a lot of unnecessary stuff.

	* src/i386.ld: Added absolute defines for IDT, VSR and virtual
	vector tables.

	* src/hal_misc.c: Tidied up and added eCos exception support.

	* src/context.S:
	Modified to save and restore context in new format.

	* include/i386_stub.h:
	Added definition of HAL_STUB_PLATFORM_STUBS_FIXUP() macro.

	* include/hal_io.h: Implemented these macros as inline assembler.

	* include/hal_intr.h: Various changes to interrupt and VSR table
	handling macros.

	* include/hal_arch.h: 
	* include/i386.inc:
	Redfined HAL_SavedRegisters structure and init macro. Now all
	contexts consist of a full register set, vector number, and
	PC,CS,EFLAGS as pushed by the hardware.

	* include/basetype.h: Changed alignment to 4 bytes.

2000-11-01  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S (hal_pc_irq): Use correct register for ISR return value
	when calling interrupt_end()
	Thanks to Phil Hinton for reporting.

2000-10-20  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S (_start): call constructors after initializing
	stub so that they can be debugged. Reported to work okay
	by Fabrice Gautier.

2000-09-05  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/basetype.h: Use 32-byte alignment

2000-08-14  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	From Fabrice Gautier:
	* src/hal_misc.c (hal_zero_bss): Use __bss_end not _end
	* src/i386.ld: Add __bss_end symbol to end of SECTION_bss

2000-06-21  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/i386_stub.c: Removed use of CYG_LABEL_NAME() and added
	underscore to _breakinst.

	* src/i386.ld: Switched to new table definition mechanism.

	* include/basetype.h: Removed definition of CYG_LABEL_NAME().
