	* include/pcmb.inc:

	* include/pcmb_serial.h:
	* src/pcmb_misc.c:
	* src/pcmb_screen.c:
	* src/pcmb_serial.c:
	Created this package to provide the support needed to run eCos
	binaries on an i386 PC using a standard motherboard. This package
	provides support for the standard PC devices: timers, interrupt
	controller, serial ports, ASCII display, keyboard, PCI bus
	etc. that are found on all PC compatible platforms.  It does not
	provide support for devices that may also be found on modern
	motherboards, such as ethernet, sound and video devices. These are
	supported by drivers elsewhere.
