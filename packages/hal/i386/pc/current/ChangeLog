2000-03-23  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* doc/RELEASENOTES.txt: Added this file to contain release notes.

2000-03-15  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_diag.c: Added code to handle keyboard input on PC when
	using SCREEN diagnostics. This is as much for completeness and
	future use than for any pressing current need.

	* include/platform.inc: Fixed some mismatches between instruction
	suffixes and operand sizes that the latest i386 assembler now
	warns about. Also tidied up GDT and IDT load code and protected
	mode switch because of warnings from assembler.

2000-03-09  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/platform.inc:
	* cdl/hal_i386_pc.cdl: Rename CYGHWR_HAL_STARTUP to
	CYG_HAL_STARTUP for consistency with other HALs (and tools).

2000-03-02  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_i386_pc.cdl (CYGBLD_GLOBAL_COMMAND_PREFIX): 
	Use i386-elf toolchain by default, although add a note in the
	description that appropriate versions of native linux tools can
	also be used.

2000-03-01  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/plf_stub.c (cyg_hal_gdb_isr): Added check for a character
	being available at the serial line. With the introduction of GDB O
	packet debugging, it is possible for this code to see a spurious
	interrupt and get stuck in hal_pc_get_char().

	* include/var_intr.h:
	Modified interrupt enable/disable code so that it is closer in
	behavior to other HALs.

	* include/platform.inc:
	Changed floppy bootstrap code so it can load binaries greater than
	64k and only loads the .text+.data parts, not the .bss.

2000-02-18  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_i386_pc.cdl (CYGBLD_BUILD_GDB_STUBS): When
	building stubs, define every dependency required here rather than
	in the template

2000-02-18  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_i386_pc_ram.mlt,
	  include/pkgconf/mlt_i386_pc_floppy.mlt:

	Add/update memory layout save files to match the corresponding
	linker script fragments.

2000-02-16  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_diag.c: Added support for generating GDB O packets when
	diagnosing to serial0.

	* include/plf_intr.h: Added missed copyright notice.
