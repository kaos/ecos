	* include/hal_cache.h: Consistently ensure that ARM registers used
	in MCR ops to cache-control coprocessors, where the data doesn't
	matter, all actually have data zero ("SBZ") as in the Jaggar book.
	This may well not be necessary, but for the sake of making sure...

2000-12-01  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_cache.h: Define addressable cache line operations
	HAL_DCACHE_STORE(), HAL_DCACHE_INVALIDATE(), HAL_DCACHE_FLUSH()
	now that I have understood how come the test (kcache2) was
	failing.  See kernel ChangeLog for details.  Also tidied up a
	couple of other minor details.

2000-11-27  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_diag.c (init_channel): UART setup required on Brutus as well.

2000-11-21  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_diag.c (init_channel): Disable broken uart setups on platforms
	other than the SA1110MM, since this code seems to be somewhat broken.

2000-10-25  Drew Moseley  <dmoseley@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_diag.c: Added UART1 support for SA1100 targets.

	* include/hal_sa11x0.h: Added GPIO bit definitions.

2000-07-14  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_diag.h (HAL_DELAY_US): Define.

	* src/sa11x0_misc.c (hal_delay_us): New function.  Used to 
	provide timers/delays in non-kernel systems.

2000-07-05  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_sa11x0.cdl: 
	* src/hal_diag.c:
	Cleaned up channel options.
	
	* src/hal_diag.c: Use per-channel structure instead of code cruft.

2000-06-30  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_diag.c: calling i/f macro changes.

2000-06-28  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_sa11x0.cdl: 
	* include/plf_stub.h:
	* src/plf_stub.c: [deleted]
	Stub uses vector table for all IO.
	
	* src/sa11x0_misc.c: Fix compiler warning.

2000-06-27  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_diag.c: Some fixes and code layout changes (Gary
	Thomas).

	* src/hal_diag.c:
	* include/hal_diag.h:
	* include/hal_sa11x0.h:
	Changed to initialize all procs tables. Added timeout getc, and
	proper debug channel switch behavior.

2000-06-24  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/sa11x0_misc.c (hal_clock_reset): Add code to compensate for
	clock drift since this hardware does not reset on interrupts.
	(hal_clock_read): Also adjust the value returned here for same reason.

2000-06-22  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_diag.c (hal_diag_write_char): 
	Fix typo: CYGINT_HAL_GDB_PORT_VECTOR to be CYGHWR_HAL_GDB_PORT_VECTOR
	
2000-06-19  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_diag.h: 
	* include/plf_stub.h: 
	* src/hal_diag.c: 
	* src/sa11x0_misc.c: Update for virtual vector (debug) support.

2000-06-12  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_diag.c: Fix baud rates for 960,19200.  Take out "announce"
	string in ROM mode.

2000-06-05  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/plf_stub.c: 
	* include/plf_stub.h: 'sa1100' shared items renamed to 'sa11x0'.

	* src/sa11x0_misc.c (hal_IRQ_handler): 
	(hal_interrupt_mask): 
	(hal_interrupt_unmask): 
	(hal_interrupt_acknowledge): 
	(hal_interrupt_configure): Complete support for GPIO interrupts.  
	Some of these are direct, others are grouped and the code needs 
	to handle both.  Also update support for GPIO edge detect interrupt 
	circuitry.
