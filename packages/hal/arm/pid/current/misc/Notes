How to build and install the GDB module on the PID

Make GDB module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 1. Configure a minimal eCos system with all packages except 'infra' disabled.
 2. Edit <hal/hal.h> to enable GDB:
    #define  CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_INCLUDE_STUBS
    #undef   CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_BREAK_SUPPORT
    #undef   CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_THREAD_SUPPORT
 3. make;make -C hal/arm/pid/<version>/misc

 Alternatively run hal/arm/pid/<version>/misc/STUBS_config.


 GDB image is in the file hal/arm/pid/<version>/misc/gdb_module.img


Make FLASH tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 1. Configure a separate eCos system with all packages enabled.
 2. Change diag chanel to port B (in file pkgconf/hal_arm_pid.h):
     #define CYGHWR_HAL_ARM_PID_DIAG_PORT     1
 2. make misc

 FLASH tool is in the file hal/arm/pid/<version>/misc/prog_flash


Prepare board for eCos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 1. Set jumper 7-8 on LK6   [using the Angle code in the 16 bit EPROM]
 2. Set jumper 5-6 on LK6   [select 8bit ROM mode]
 3. Set jumper LK18         [ROM remap - this is also required for eCos]
 4. Set S1 to 0-0-1-1       [20MHz operation]


Program FLASH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 1. Download the image onto the PID board:
      arm-elf-gdb -nw hal/arm/pid/<version>/misc/gdb_module.img

      (gdb) target rdi s=<serial device>
      (gdb) load
      [...]
      (gdb) quit

   This will download the stubs onto the board at 0x60000..0x64000

 2. Now download the FLASH programmer tool
      arm-elf-gdb -nw hal/arm/pid/<version>/misc/prog_flash

      (gdb) target rdi s=<serial device>
      (gdb) load
      [...]
      (gdb) cont

 3. The FLASH tool will output some text on the board serial port B at
    38400 baud:

       ARM eCos
       FLASH here!
       manuf: 8, device: 40
       Error: Wrong Manufaturer: 08
       ... Please change FLASH jumper

 4. This text is repeated until you remove the jumper 7-8 on LK6. Then
    the output should be:

       manuf: 1F, device: A4
       AT29C040A recognised
       About to program FLASH using data at 60000..64000
       *** Press RESET now to abort!
    
 5. You have about 10 seconds to abort the operation by pressing
    reset. After this timeout, the FLASH programming happens:
  
      ...Programming FLASH
      All done!

 6. Quit/kill the GDB process which will hang.

 7. Next time you reset the board, the stub will be in control, communicating
    on serial port A at 38400 baud. See documentation for further details
    on how to connect with GDB.



Big-Endian operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  1) If the board is to be used in big-endian mode, the stub should be
     configured for platform 'pidbe' instead of 'pid'. 'pidbe' can also
     be used as a second argument to the STUBS_config script.

 2a) If a big-endian rom controller is installed on the board, the
     programming of a new stub into flash is covered in the ARM PID
     manual.

 2b) If a big-endian rom controller is _not_ used, this is what you
     must do:

       1) Follow the above instructions (including jumper settings) ,
          but instead of using the 'prog_flash' FLASH tool, use the
          'prog_flash_BE_image_LE_system' FLASH tool.

       2) Instead of resetting the board after the FLASH has been
          programmed, switch off the power and enable jumper LK4.

     If you have to re-program the FLASH later, you can follow the
     steps above again, but also disable jumper LK4 when changing the
     other jumpers.
