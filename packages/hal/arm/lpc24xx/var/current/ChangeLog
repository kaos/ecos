	* cdl/hal_arm_lpc24xx.cdl: Added I2C configuration options for
	  interrupt priority, peripheral clock divider and I2C bus
	  frequency
	* include/lpc24xx_misc.h: Added function hal_lpc_set_power() and
	  peripheral identifiers for enabling peripheral modules in a
	  common way
	* include/var_io.h: Removed CYGARC_HAL_LPC24XX_SET_PIN_FUN()
	* src/lpc24xx_misc.c: Bugfix in hal_lpc_get_pclk(), Added function
	  hal_lpc_set_power(), Added hal_set_pin_function(), Added
	  peripheral clock divider configuration for I2C modules in
	  hal_hardware_init()
	
2008-09-11  Uwe Kindler  <uwe_kindler@web.de>

	* include/var_io.h: Added CYGARC_HAL_LPC2XXX_REG_EMAC_BASE to support
	  LPC2xxx ethernet driver
	
2008-07-21  Uwe Kindler  <uwe_kindler@web.de>

	* src/lpc2xxx_misc.c: Added hal_lpc_can_init() to initialize CAN
	channels
	* cdl/hal_arm_lpc24xx.cdl: Added a number of CYGHWR_HAL_ARM_LPC2XXX_xxx
	options for device driver compatibility reasons. Some LPC2xxx device
	drivers rely on these definitions. Moved some configuration options
	to make configuration more intuitive in configuration tool. Added
	CYGNUM_HAL_ARM_LPC2XXX_CAN_CLK option for configuration of CAN 
	peripheral clock.
	* include/var_io.h: Added macro CYGARC_HAL_LPC24XX_SET_PIN_FUN()
	* src/lpc2xxx_misc.c: Added function hal_lpc_set_pclk() to set
	peripheral clocks easily. Initialize peripheral clocks in
	hal_hardware_init() according to configuration.
	
2008-07-06  Uwe Kindler  <uwe_kindler@web.de>

	* Initial release of LPC24xx variant support (based on LPX2xxx variant)
	* src/hal_diag.c: 
	* src/lpc2xxx_misc.c: 
	* include/plf_stub.h: 
	* include/var_io.h: 
	* include/var_arch.h: 
	* include/hal_var_ints.h: 
	* include/hal_diag.h: 
	* include/hal_cache.h: 
	* cdl/hal_arm_lpc24xx.cdl: New port - based on LPX2xxx variant.
