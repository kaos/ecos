<refsect1><title>Introduction</title>
<para>
The eCos USB slave support allows developers to produce USB
peripherals. It consists of a number of different eCos packages:
</para>
<orderedlist>

<listitem>
<para>
Device drivers for specific implementations of USB slave hardware, for
example the on-chip USB Device Controller provided by the Intel SA1110
processor. A typical USB peripheral will only provide one USB slave
port and therefore only one such device driver package will be needed.
Usually the device driver package will be loaded automatically when
you create an eCos configuration for target hardware that has a USB
slave device. If you select a target which does have a USB slave
device but no USB device driver is loaded, this implies that no such
device driver is currently available.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
The common USB slave package. This serves two purposes. It defines the
API that specific device drivers should implement. It also provides
various utilities that will be needed by most USB device drivers and
applications, such as handlers for standard control messages.
Usually this package will be loaded automatically at the same time as
the USB device driver.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
The common USB package. This merely provides some information common
to both the host and slave sides of USB, such as details of the
control protocol. It is also used to place the other USB-related
packages appropriately in the overall configuration hierarchy. Usually
this package will be loaded at the same time as the USB device driver.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Class-specific USB support packages. These make it easier to develop
specific classes of USB peripheral, such as a USB-ethernet device. If
no suitable package is available for a given class of peripheral then
the USB device driver can instead be accessed directly from
application code. Such packages will never be loaded automatically
since the configuration system has no way of knowing what class of USB
peripheral is being developed. Instead developers have to add the
appropriate package or packages explicitly.
</para>
</listitem>

</orderedlist>

<para>
These packages only provide support for developing USB peripherals,
not USB hosts.
</para>
</refsect1>

<refsect1><title>USB Concepts</title>
<para>
Information about USB can be obtained from a number of sources
including the <ulink url="http://www.usb.org/">USB Implementers Forum
web site</ulink>. Only a brief summary is provided here.
</para>
<para>
A USB network is asymmetrical: it consists of a single host, one or
more slave devices, and possibly some number of intermediate hubs. The
host side is significantly more complicated than the slave side.
Essentially, all operations are initiated by the host. For example, if
the host needs to receive some data from a particular USB peripheral
then it will send an IN token to that peripheral; the latter should
respond with either a NAK or with appropriate data. Similarly, when
the host wants to transmit data to a peripheral it will send an OUT
token followed by the data; the peripheral will return a NAK if it is
currently unable to receive more data or if there was corruption,
otherwise it will return an ACK. All transfers are check-summed and
there is a clearly-defined error recovery process. USB peripherals can
only interact with the host, not with each other.
</para>
<para>
USB supports four different types of communication: control messages,
interrupt transfers, isochronous transfers, and bulk transfers.
Control messages are further subdivided into four categories:
standard, class, vendor and a reserved category. All USB peripherals
must respond to certain standard control messages, and usually this
will be handled by the common USB slave package (for complicated
peripherals, application support will be needed). Class and vendor
control messages may be handled by an class-specific USB support
package, for example the USB-ethernet package will handle control
messages such as getting the MAC address or enabling/disabling
promiscuous mode. Alternatively, some or all of these messages will
have to be handled by application code.
</para>
<para>
Interrupt transfers are used for devices which need to be polled
regularly. For example, a USB keyboard might be polled once every
millisecond. The host will not poll the device more frequently than
this, so interrupt transfers are best suited to peripherals that
involve a relatively small amount of data. Isochronous transfers are
intended for multimedia-related peripherals where typically a large
amount of video or audio data needs to be exchanged continuously.
Given appropriate host support a USB peripheral can reserve some of
the available bandwidth. Isochronous transfers are not reliable; if a
particular packet is corrupted then it will just be discarded and
software is expected to recover from this. Bulk transfers are used for
everything else: after taking care of any pending control, isochronous
and interrupt transfers the host will use whatever bandwidth remains
for bulk transfers. Bulk transfers are reliable.
</para>
<para>
Transfers are organized into USB packets, with the details depending
on the transfer type. Control messages always involve an initial
8-byte packet from host to peripheral, optionally followed by some
additional packets; in theory these additional packets can be up to 64
bytes, but hardware may limit it to 8 bytes. Interrupt transfers
involve a single packet of up to 64 bytes. Isochronous transfers
involve a single packet of up to 1024 bytes. Bulk transfers involve
multiple packets. There will be some number, possibly zero, of 64-byte
packets. The transfer is terminated by a single packet of less than 64
bytes. If the transfer involves an exact multiple of 64 bytes than the
final packet will be 0 bytes, consisting of just a header and checksum
which typically will be generated by the hardware. There is no
pre-defined limit on the size of a bulk transfer. Instead higher-level
protocols are expected to handle this, so for a USB-ethernet
peripheral the protocol could impose a limit of 1514 bytes of data
plus maybe some additional protocol overhead.
</para>
<para>
Transfers from the host to a peripheral are addressed not just to that
peripheral but to a specific endpoint within that peripheral.
Similarly, the host requests incoming data from a specific endpoint
rather than from the peripheral as a whole. For example, a combined
keyboard/touchpad device could provide the keyboard events on endpoint
1 and the mouse events on endpoint 2. A given USB peripheral can have
up to 16 endpoints for incoming data and another 16 for outgoing data.
However, given the comparatively high speed of USB I/O this endpoint
addressing is typically implemented in hardware rather than software,
and the hardware will only implement a small number of endpoints.
Endpoint 0 is generally used only for control messages.
</para>
<para>
In practice, many of these details are irrelevant to application code
or to class packages. Instead, such higher-level code usually just
performs blocking <function>read</function> and
<function>write</function>, or non-blocking USB-specific calls, to
transfer data between host and target via a specific endpoint. Control
messages are more complicated but are usually handled by existing
code.
</para>
<para>
When a USB peripheral is plugged into the host there is an initial
enumeration and configuration process. The peripheral provides
information such as its class of device (audio, video, etc.), a
vendor id, which endpoints should be used for what kind of data, and
so on. The host OS uses this information to identify a suitable host
device driver. This could be a generic driver for a class of
peripherals, or it could be a vendor-specific driver. Assuming a
suitable driver is installed the host will then activate the USB
peripheral and perform additional application-specific initialisation.
For example for a USB-ethernet device this would involve obtaining an
ethernet MAC address. Most USB peripherals will be fairly simple, but
it is possible to build multifunction peripherals with multiple
configurations, interfaces, and alternate interface settings.
</para>
<para>
It is not possible for any of the eCos packages to generate all the
enumeration data automatically. Some of the required information such
as the vendor id cannot be supplied by generic packages; only by the
application developer. Class support code such as the USB-ethernet
package could in theory supply some of the information automatically,
but there are also hardware dependencies such as which endpoints get
used for incoming and outgoing ethernet frames. Instead it is the
responsibility of the application developer to provide all the
enumeration data and perform some additional initialisation. In
addition, the common USB slave package can handle all the standard
control messages for a simple USB peripheral, but for something like a
multifunction peripheral additional application support is needed.
</para>

<note><para>
The initial implementation of the eCos USB slave packages involved
hardware that only supported control and bulk transfers, not
isochronous or interrupt. There may be future changes to the USB
code and API to allow for isochronous and interrupt transfers,
especially the former. Other changes may be required to support
different USB devices. At present there is no support for USB remote
wakeups, since again it is not supported by the hardware.
</para></note>

</refsect1>

<refsect1><title>eCos USB I/O Facilities</title>
<para>
For protocols other than control messages, eCos provides two ways of
performing USB I/O. The first involves device table or devtab entries such
as <link linkend="usbs-devtab"><literal>/dev/usb1r</literal></link>,
with one entry per endpoint per USB device. It is possible to
<function>open</function> these devices and use conventional blocking
I/O functions such as <function>read</function> and
<function>write</function> to exchange data between host and
peripheral.
</para>
<para>
There is also a lower-level USB-specific API, consisting of functions
such as <link
linkend="usbs-start-rx"><function>usbs_start_rx_buffer</function></link>.
A USB device driver will supply a data structure for each endpoint,
for example a <link
linkend="usbs-data"><structname>usbs_rx_endpoint</structname></link>
structure for every receive endpoint. The first argument to
<function>usbs_start_rx_buffer</function> should be a pointer to such
a data structure. The USB-specific API is non-blocking: the initial
call merely starts the transfer; some time later, once the transfer
has completed or has been aborted, the device driver will invoke a
completion function.
</para>
<para>
Control messages are different. With four different categories of
control messages including application and vendor specific ones, the
conventional
<function>open</function>/<function>read</function>/<function>write</function>
model of I/O cannot easily be applied. Instead, a USB device driver
will supply a <link
linkend="usbs-control"><structname>usbs_control_endpoint</structname></link>
data structure which can be manipulated appropriately. In practice the
standard control messages will usually be handled by the common USB
slave package, and other control messages will be handled by
class-specific code such as the USB-ethernet package. Typically,
application code remains responsible for supplying the <link
linkend="usbs-enum">enumeration data</link> and for actually <link
linkend="usbs-start">starting</link> up the USB device.
</para>
</refsect1>

<refsect1><title>Enabling the USB code</title>
<para>
If the target hardware contains a USB slave device then the
appropriate USB device driver and the common packages will typically
be loaded into the configuration automatically when that target is
selected (assuming a suitable device driver exists). However, the
driver will not necessarily be active. For example a processor might
have an on-chip USB device, but not all applications using that
processor will want to use USB functionality. Hence by default the USB
device is disabled, ensuring that applications do not suffer any
memory or other penalties for functionality that is not required.
</para>
<para>
If the application developer explicitly adds a class support package
such as the USB-ethernet one then this implies that the USB device is
actually needed, and the device will be enabled automatically.
However, if no suitable class package is available and the USB device
will instead be accessed by application code, it is necessary to
enable the USB device manually. Usually the easiest way to do this is
to enable the configuration option
<literal>CYGGLO_IO_USB_SLAVE_APPLICATION</literal>, and the USB device
driver and related packages will adjust accordingly. Alternatively,
the device driver may provide some configuration options to provide
more fine-grained control.

<refsect1><title>USB Enumeration Data</title>
<para>
When a USB host detects that a peripheral has been plugged in or
powered up, one of the first steps is to ask the peripheral to
describe itself by supplying enumeration data. Some of this data
depends on the class of peripheral. Other fields are vendor-specific.
There is also a dependency on the hardware, specifically which
endpoints are available should be used. In general it is not possible
for generic code to provide this information, so it is the
responsibility of application code to provide a suitable
<structname>usbs_enumeration_data</structname> data structure and
install it in the endpoint 0 data structure during initialization.
This must happen before the USB device is enabled by a call to
<function>usbs_start</function>, for example:
</para>
<programlisting width=72>
const usbs_enumeration_data usb_enum_data = {
    &hellip;
};

int
main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    usbs_sa11x0_ep0.enumeration_data = &amp;usb_enum_data;
    &hellip;
    usbs_start(&amp;usbs_sa11x0_ep0);
    &hellip;
}
</programlisting>
<para>
For most applications the enumeration data will be static, although
the <structname>usbs_enumeration_data</structname> structure can be
filled in at run-time if necessary. Full details of the enumeration
data can be found in the Universal Serial Bus specification obtainable
from the <ulink url="http://www.usb.org/">USB Implementers Forum web
site</ulink>, although the meaning of most fields is fairly obvious.
The various data structures and utility macros are defined in the
header files <filename class="headerfile">cyg/io/usb/usb.h</filename>
and <filename class="headerfile">cyg/io/usb/usbs.h</filename>. Note
that the example code below makes use of the gcc labelled element
extension.
</para>

<refsect2><title><structname>usb_device_descriptor</structname></title>
<para>
The main information about a USB peripheral comes from a single
<structname>usb_device_descriptor</structname> structure, which is
embedded in the <structname>usbs_enumeration_data</structname>
structure. A typical example might look like this:
</para>
<programlisting width=72>
const usbs_enumeration_data usb_enum_data = {
    {
        length:                 USB_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR_LENGTH,
        type:                   USB_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE,
        usb_spec_lo:            USB_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR_USB11_LO,
        usb_spec_hi:            USB_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR_USB11_HI,
        device_class:           USB_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR_CLASS_VENDOR,
        device_subclass:        USB_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR_SUBCLASS_VENDOR,
        device_protocol:        USB_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR_PROTOCOL_VENDOR,
        max_packet_size:        8,
        vendor_lo:              0x42,
        vendor_hi:              0x42,
        product_lo:             0x42,
        product_hi:             0x42,
        device_lo:              0x00,
        device_hi:              0x01,
        manufacturer_str:       1,
        product_str:            2,
        serial_number_str:      0,
        number_configurations:  1
    },
    &hellip;
};
</programlisting>
<para>
The length and type fields are specified by the USB standard. The
<structfield>usb_spec_lo</structfield> and
<structfield>usb_spec_hi</structfield> fields identify the particular
revision of the standard that the peripheral implements, for example
revision 1.1.
</para>
<para>
The device class, subclass, and protocol fields are used by generic
host-side USB software to determine which host-side device driver
should be loaded to interact with the peripheral. A number of standard
classes are defined, for example mass-storage devices and
human-interface devices. If a peripheral implements one of the
standard classes then a standard existing host-side device driver may
exist, eliminating the need to write a custom driver. The value
<literal>0xFF</literal> (<literal>VENDOR</literal>) is reserved for
peripherals that implement a vendor-specific protocol rather than a
standard one. Such peripherals will require a custom host-side device
driver. The value <literal>0x00</literal>
(<literal>INTERFACE</literal>) is reserved and indicates that the
protocol used by the peripheral is defined at the interface level
rather than for the peripheral as a whole.
</para>
<para>
The <structfield>max_package_size</structfield> field specifies the
maximum length of a control message. There is a lower bound of eight
bytes, and typical hardware will not support anything larger because
control messages are usually small and not performance-critical.
</para>
<para>
The <structfield>vendor_lo</structfield> and
<structfield>vendor_hi</structfield> fields specify a vendor id, which
must be obtained from the USB Implementor's Forum. The numbers used in
the code fragment above are examples only and must not be used in real
USB peripherals. The product identifier is determined by the vendor,
and different USB peripherals should use different identifiers. The
device identifier field should indicate a release number in
binary-coded decimal.
</para>
<para>
The above fields are all numerical in nature. A USB peripheral can
also provide a number of strings as described <link
linkend="usbs-enum-strings">below</link>, for example the name of the
vendor can be provided. The various <structfield>_str</structfield>
fields act as indices into an array of strings, with index 0
indicating that no string is available. 
</para>
<para>
A typical USB peripheral involves just a single configuration. However
more complicated peripherals can support multiple configurations. Only
one configuration will be active at any one time, and the host will
switch between them as appropriate. If a peripheral does involve
multiple configurations then typically it will be the responsibility
of application code to <link
linkend="usbs-control-standard">handle</link> the standard
set-configuration control message.
</para>
</refsect2>

<refsect2><title><structname>usb_configuration_descriptor</structname></title>
<para>
A USB peripheral involves at least one and possible several different
configurations. The <structname>usbs_enumeration_data</structname>
structure requires a pointer to an array, possibly of length 1, of
<structname>usb_configuration_descriptor</structname> structures.
Usually a single structure suffices:
</para>
<programlisting width=72>
const usb_configuration_descriptor usb_configuration = {
    length:             USB_CONFIGURATION_DESCRIPTOR_LENGTH,
    type:               USB_CONFIGURATION_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE,
    total_length_lo:    USB_CONFIGURATION_DESCRIPTOR_TOTAL_LENGTH_LO(1, 2),
    total_length_hi:    USB_CONFIGURATION_DESCRIPTOR_TOTAL_LENGTH_HI(1, 2),
    number_interfaces:  1,
    configuration_id:   1,
    configuration_str:  0,
    attributes:         USB_CONFIGURATION_DESCRIPTOR_ATTR_REQUIRED |
                        USB_CONFIGURATION_DESCRIPTOR_ATTR_SELF_POWERED,
    max_power:          50
};

const usbs_enumeration_data usb_enum_data = {
    &hellip;
    configurations:             &amp;usb_configuration,
    &hellip;
};
</programlisting>
<para>
The values for the <structfield>length</structfield> and
<structfield>type</structfield> fields are determined by the standard.
The <structfield>total_length</structfield> field depends on the
number of interfaces and endpoints used by this configuration, and
convenience macros are provided to calculate this: the first argument
to the macros specify the number of interfaces, the second the number
of endpoints. The <structfield>number_interfaces</structfield> field
is self-explanatory. If the peripheral involves multiple
configurations then each one must have a unique id, and this will be
used in the set-configuration control message. The id
<literal>0</literal> is reserved, and a set-configuration control
message that uses this id indicates that the peripheral should be
inactive. Configurations can have a string description if required.
The <structfield>attributes</structfield> field must have the
<literal>REQUIRED</literal> bit set; the
<literal>SELF_POWERED</literal> bit informs the host that the
peripheral has its own power supply and will not draw any power over
the bus, leaving more bus power available to other peripherals; the
<literal>REMOTE_WAKEUP</literal> bit is used if the peripheral can
interrupt the host when the latter is in power-saving mode. For
peripherals that are not self-powered, the
<structfield>max_power</structfield> field specifies the power
requirements in units of 2mA.
</para>
</refsect2>

<refsect2><title><structname>usb_interface_descriptor</structname></title>
<para>
A USB configuration involves one or more interfaces, typically
corresponding to different streams of data. For example, one interface
might involve video data while another interface is for audio.
Multiple interfaces in a single configuration will be active at the
same time.
</para>
<programlisting width=72>

Again, the <structfield>length</structfield> and

Each interface within a configuration requires its own id. However, a
given interface may have several alternate settings, in other words
entries in the interfaces array with the same id but different
<structfield>alternate_setting</structfield> fields. For example,
there might be one setting which requires a bandwidth of 100K/s and
another setting that only needs 50K/s. The host can use the standard
set-interface control message to choose the most appropriate setting.
The handling of this request is the responsibility of higher-level
code, so the application may have to <link

<para>
The number of endpoints used by an interface is specified in the
<structfield>number_endpoints</structfield> field. Exact details of
which endpoints are used is held in a separate array of endpoint
descriptors. The class, subclass and protocol fields are used by
host-side code to determine which host-side device driver should
handle this specific interface. Usually this is determined on a
per-peripheral basis in the
<structname>usb_device_descriptor</structname> structure, but that can
defer the details to individual interfaces. A per-interface string
is allowed as well.

<para>
As usual the values for the <structfield>length</structfield> and
<structfield>type</structfield> fields are specified by the standard.
The <structfield>endpoint</structfield> field gives both the endpoint
number and the direction, so in the above example endpoint 1 is used
for OUT (host to peripheral) transfers and endpoint 2 is used for IN
(peripheral to host) transfers. The
<structfield>attributes</structfield> field indicates the USB protocol
that should be used on this endpoint: <literal>CONTROL</literal>,
<literal>ISOCHRONOUS</literal>, <literal>BULK</literal> or
<literal>INTERRUPT</literal>. The
<structfield>max_packet</structfield> field specifies the maximum size
of a single USB packet. For bulk transfers this will typically be 64
bytes. For isochronous transfers this can be up to 1023 bytes. For
interrupt transfers it can be up to 64 bytes, although usually a
smaller value will be used. The <structfield>interval</structfield>
field is ignored for control and bulk transfers. For isochronous
transfers it should be set to 1. For interrupt transfers it can be a
value between 1 and 255, and indicates the number of milliseconds
between successive polling operations.
</para>
<para>
For USB peripherals involving multiple configurations or interfaces
the array of endpoint descriptors should be organized sequentially:
first the endpoints corresponding to the first interface of the first
configuration, then the second interface in that configuration, and so
on; then all the endpoints for all the interfaces in the second
configuration; etc.

The enumeration data can contain a number of strings with additional
information. Unicode encoding is used for the strings, and it is
possible for a peripheral to supply a given string in multiple
languages using the appropriate characters. The first two bytes of
each string give a length and type field. The first string is special;
after the two bytes header it consists of an array of 2-byte language
id codes, indicating the supported languages. The language code
0x0409 corresponds to English (United States).

<para>
Initializing a USB device requires some support from higher-level
code, typically the application, in the form of enumeration data.
Hence it is not possible for the low-level USB driver to activate a
USB device itself. Instead the higher-level code has to take care of
this by invoking <function>usbs_start</function>. This function takes
a pointer to a USB control endpoint data structure. USB device drivers
should provide exactly one such data structure for every USB device,
so the pointer uniquely identifies the device.

</programlisting>
<para>
The exact behaviour of <function>usbs_start</function> depends on the
USB hardware and the device driver. A typical implementation would
change the USB data pins from tristated to active. If the peripheral
is already plugged into a host then the latter should detect this
change and start interacting with the peripheral, including requesting
the enumeration data. Some of this may happen before
<function>usbs_start</function> returns, but given that multiple
interactions between USB host and peripheral are required it is likely
that the function will return before the peripheral is fully
configured. Control endpoints provide a <link
linkend="usbs-control-state">mechanism</link> for informing
higher-level code of USB state changes.
<function>usbs_start</function> will return even if the peripheral is
not currently connected to a host: it will not block until the
connection is established.
</para>
<para>
<function>usbs_start</function> should only be called once for a given
USB device. There are no defined error conditions. Note that the
function affects the entire USB device and not just the control
endpoint: there is no need to start any data endpoints as well.

<refsect1><title>Devtab Entries</title>
<para>
USB device drivers provide two ways of transferring data between host
and peripheral. The first involves USB-specific functionality such as
<link
linkend="usbs-start-rx"><function>usbs_start_rx_buffer</function></link>.
This provides non-blocking I/O: a transfer is started, and some time
later the device driver will call a supplied completion function. The
second uses the conventional I/O model: there are entries in the
device table corresponding to the various endpoints. Standard calls
such as <function>open</function> can then be used to get a suitable
handle. Actual I/O happens via blocking <function>read</function> and
<function>write</function> calls. In practice the blocking operations
are simply implemented using the underlying non-blocking
functionality.
</para>
<para>
Each endpoint will have its own devtab entry. The exact names are
controlled by the device driver package, but typically the root will
be <literal>/dev/usb</literal>. This is followed by one or more
decimal digits giving the endpoint number, followed by
<literal>c</literal> for a control endpoint, <literal>r</literal> for
a receive endpoint (host to peripheral), and <literal>w</literal> for
a transmit endpoint (peripheral to host). If the target hardware
involves more than one USB device then different roots should be used,
for example <literal>/dev/usb0c</literal> and
<literal>/dev/usb1_0c</literal>. This may require explicit
manipulation of device driver configuration options by the application
developer.
</para>
<para>
At present the devtab entry for a control endpoint does not support
any I/O operations. 
</para>

<refsect2><title><function>write</function> operations</title>
<para>
<function>cyg_io_write</function> and similar functions in
higher-level packages can be used to perform a transfer from
peripheral to host. Successive write operations will not be coalesced.
For example, when doing a 1000 byte write to an endpoint that uses the
bulk transfer protocol this will involve 15 full-size 64-byte packets
and a terminating 40-byte packet. USB device drivers are not expected
to do any locking, and if higher-level code performs multiple
concurrent write operations on a single endpoint then the resulting
behaviour is undefined.
</para>
<para>
A USB <function>write</function> operation will never transfer less
data than specified. It is the responsibility of higher-level code to
ensure that the amount of data being transferred is acceptable to the
host-side code. Usually this will be defined by a higher-level
protocol. If an attempt is made to transfer more data than the host
expects then the resulting behaviour is undefined.
</para>
<para>
There are two likely error conditions. <literal>EPIPE</literal>
indicates that the connection between host and target has been broken.
<literal>EAGAIN</literal> indicates that the endpoint has been
stalled, either at the request of the host or by other activity
inside the peripheral.
</para>
</refsect2>

<refsect2><title><function>read</function> operations</title>
<para>
<function>cyg_io_read</function> and similar functions in higher-level
packages can be used to perform a transfer from host to peripheral.
This should be a complete transfer: higher-level protocols should
define an upper bound on the amount of data being transferred, and the
<function>read</function> operation should involve at least this
amount of data. The return value will indicate the actual transfer
size, which may be less than requested.
</para>
<para>
Some device drivers may support partial reads, but USB device drivers
are not expected to perform any buffering because that involves both
memory and code overheads. One technique that may work for bulk
transfers is to exploit the fact that such transfers happen in 64-byte
packets. It is possible to <function>read</function> an initial 64
bytes, corresponding to the first packet in the transfer. These 64
bytes can then be examined to determine the total transfer size, and
the remaining data can be transferred in another
<function>read</function> operation. This technique is not guaranteed
to work with all USB hardware. Also, if the delay between accepting
the first packet and the remainder of the transfer is excessive then
this could cause timeout problems for the host-side software. For
these reasons the use of partial reads should be avoided.

<refsect2><title><function>select</function> operations</title>
<para>
Typical USB device drivers will not provide any support for
<function>select</function>. Consider bulk transfers from the host to
the peripheral. At the USB device driver level there is no way of
knowing in advance how large a transfer will be, so it is not feasible
for the device driver to buffer the entire transfer. It may be
possible to buffer part of the transfer, for example the first 64-byte
packet, and copy this into application space at the start of a
<function>read</function>, but this adds code and memory overheads.
Worse, it means that there is an unknown but potentially long delay
between a peripheral accepting the first packet of a transfer and the
remaining packets, which could confuse or upset the host-side
software.
</para>
<para>
With some USB hardware it may be possible for the device driver to
detect OUT tokens from the host without actually accepting the data,
and this would indicate that a  <function>read</function> is likely to
succeed. However, it would not be reliable since the host-side I/O
operation could time out. A similar mechanism could be used to
implement <function>select</function> for outgoing data, but again
this would not be reliable.
</para>
<para>
Some device drivers may provide partial support for
<function>select</function> anyway, possibly under the control of a
configuration option. The device driver's documentation should be
consulted for further information. It is also worth noting that the
USB-specific non-blocking API can often be used as an alternative to
<function>select</function>.
</para>
</refsect2>

<refsect2><title><function>get_config</function> and

<para>
There are no <function>set_config</function> or
<function>get_config</function> (also known as
<function>ioctl</function>) operations defined for USB devices.
Some device drivers may provide hardware-specific facilities this way. 
</para>
<note>
<para>
Currently the USB-specific functions related to <link
linkend="usbs-halt">halted endpoints</link> cannot be accessed readily
via devtab entries. This functionality should probably be made
available via <function>set_config</function> and
<function>get_config</function>. It may also prove useful to provide
a <function>get_config</function> operation that maps from the
devtab entries to the underlying endpoint data structures.
</para>
</note>
</refsect2>

<refsect2><title>Presence</title>
<para>
The devtab entries are optional. If the USB device is accessed
primarily by class-specific code such as the USB-ethernet package and
that package uses the USB-specific API directly, the devtab entries
are redundant. Even if application code does need to access the USB
device, the non-blocking API may be more convenient than the blocking
I/O provided via the devtab entries. In these cases the devtab entries
serve no useful purpose, but they still impose a memory overhead. It
is possible to suppress the presence of these entries by disabling the
configuration option

<para>
<function>usbs_start_rx_buffer</function> is a USB-specific function
to accept a transfer from host to peripheral. It can be used for bulk,
interrupt or isochronous transfers, but not for control messages.
Instead those involve manipulating the <link
linkend="usbs-control"><structname>usbs_control_endpoint</structname></link>
data structure directly. The function takes five arguments:
</para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
The first argument identifies the specific endpoint that should be
used. Different USB devices will support different sets of endpoints
and the device driver will provide appropriate data structures. The
device driver's documentation should be consulted for details of which
endpoints are available.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
The <parameter>buffer</parameter> and <parameter>length</parameter>
arguments control the actual transfer. USB device drivers are not
expected to perform any buffering or to support partial transfers, so
the length specified should correspond to the maximum transfer that is
currently possible and the buffer should be at least this large. For
isochronous transfers the USB specification imposes an upper bound of
1023 bytes, and a smaller limit may be set in the <link
linkend="usbs-enum-endpoint">enumeration data</link>. Interrupt
transfers are similarly straightforward with an upper bound of 64
bytes, or less as per the enumeration data. Bulk transfers are more
complicated because they can involve multiple 64-byte packets plus a
terminating packet of less than 64 bytes, so there is no predefined
limit on the transfer size. Instead it is left to higher-level
protocols to specify an appropriate upper bound.
</para>
<para>
One technique that may work for bulk transfers is to exploit the fact
that such transfers happen in 64-byte packets: it may be possible to
receive an initial 64 bytes, corresponding to the first packet in the
transfer; these 64 bytes can then be examined to determine the total
transfer size, and the remaining data can be transferred in another
receive operation. This technique is not guaranteed to work with all
USB hardware. Also, if the delay between accepting the first packet and
the remainder of the transfer is excessive then this could cause
timeout problems for the host-side software. For these reasons this
technique should be avoided.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
<function>usbs_start_rx_buffer</function> is non-blocking. It merely
starts the receive operation, and does not wait for completion. At
some later point the USB device driver will invoke the completion
function parameter with two arguments: the completion data defined by
the last parameter and a result field. A result &gt;=
<literal>0</literal> indicates a successful transfer of that many
bytes, which may be less than the upper bound imposed by the
<parameter>length</parameter> argument. A result &lt;
<literal>0</literal> indicates an error. The most likely errors are
<literal>-EPIPE</literal> to indicate that the connection between the
host and the target has been broken, and <literal>-EAGAIN</literal>
for when the endpoint has been <link
linkend="usbs-halt">halted</link>. Specific USB device drivers may
specify additional error conditions.
</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<para>
The normal sequence of events is that the USB device driver will
update the appropriate hardware registers. At some point after that
the host will attempt to send data by transmitting an OUT token
followed by a data packet, and since a receive operation is now in
progress the data will be accepted and ACK'd. If there were no receive
operation then the peripheral would instead generate a NAK. The USB
hardware will generate an interrupt once the whole packet has been
received, and the USB device driver will service this interrupt and
arrange for a DSR to be called. Isochronous and interrupt transfers
involve just a single packet. However, bulk transfers may involve
multiple packets so the device driver has to check whether the packet
was a full 64 bytes or whether it was a terminating packet of less
than this. When the device driver DSR detects a complete transfer it
will inform higher-level code by invoking the supplied completion
function.
</para>
<para>
This means that the completion function will normally be invoked by a
DSR and not in thread context - although some USB device drivers may
have a different implementation. Therefore the completion function is
restricted in what it can do. In particular it must not make any
calls that will or may block such as locking a mutex or allocating
memory. The kernel documentation should be consulted for more details
of DSR's and interrupt handling generally.
</para>
<para>
It is possible that the completion function will be invoked before
<function>usbs_start_rx_buffer</function> returns. Such an event would
be unusual because the transfer cannot happen until the next time the
host tries to send data to this peripheral, but it may happen if for
example another interrupt happens and a higher priority thread is
scheduled to run. Also, if the endpoint is currently halted then the
completion function will be invoked immediately with
<literal>-EAGAIN</literal>: typically this will happen in the current
thread rather than in a separate DSR. The completion function is
allowed to start another transfer immediately by calling
<function>usbs_start_rx_buffer</function> again.
</para>
<para>
USB device drivers are not expected to perform any locking. It is the
responsibility of higher-level code to ensure that there is only one
receive operation for a given endpoint in progress at any one time. If
there are concurrent calls to
<function>usbs_start_rx_buffer</function> then the resulting behaviour
is undefined. For typical USB applications this does not present any
problems, because only one piece of code will access a given endpoint
at any particular time.
</para>
<para>
The following code fragment illustrates a very simple use of
<function>usbs_start_rx_buffer</function> to implement a blocking
receive, using a semaphore to synchronise between the foreground
thread and the DSR. For a simple example like this no completion data
is needed.

<para>
The <parameter>buffer</parameter> and <parameter>length</parameter>
arguments control the actual transfer. USB device drivers are not
allowed to modify the buffer during the transfer, so the data can
reside in read-only memory. The transfer will be for all the data
specified, and it is the responsibility of higher-level code to make
sure that the host is expecting this amount of data. For isochronous
transfers the USB specification imposes an upper bound of 1023 bytes,
but a smaller limit may be set in the <link
linkend="usbs-enum-endpoint">enumeration data</link>. Interrupt
transfers have an upper bound of 64 bytes or less, as per the
enumeration data. Bulk transfers are more complicated because they can
involve multiple 64-byte packets plus a terminating packet of less
than 64 bytes, so the basic USB specification does not impose an upper
limit on the total transfer size. Instead it is left to higher-level
protocols to specify an appropriate upper bound. If the peripheral
attempts to send more data than the host is willing to accept then the
resulting behaviour is undefined and may well depend on the specific
host operating system being used.
</para>
<para>
For bulk transfers, the USB device driver or the underlying hardware
will automatically split the transfer up into the appropriate number
of full-size 64-byte packets plus a single terminating packet, which
may be 0 bytes.

<listitem>
<para>
<function>usbs_start_tx_buffer</function> is non-blocking. It merely
starts the transmit operation, and does not wait for completion. At
some later point the USB device driver will invoke the completion
function parameter with two arguments: the completion data defined by
the last parameter, and a result field. This result will be either an
error code &lt; <literal>0</literal>, or the amount of data
transferred which should correspond to the
<parameter>length</parameter> argument. The most likely errors are
<literal>-EPIPE</literal> to indicate that the connection between the
host and the target has been broken, and <literal>-EAGAIN</literal>
for when the endpoint has been <link
linkend="usbs-halt">halted</link>. Specific USB device drivers may
define additional error conditions.
</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<para>
The normal sequence of events is that the USB device driver will
update the appropriate hardware registers. At some point after that
the host will attempt to fetch data by transmitting an IN token. Since
a transmit operation is now in progress the peripheral can send a
packet of data, and the host will generate an ACK. At this point the
USB hardware will generate an interrupt, and the device driver will
service this interrupt and arrange for a DSR to be called. Isochronous
and interrupt transfers involve just a single packet. However, bulk
transfers may involve multiple packets so the device driver has to
check whether there is more data to send and set things up for the
next packet. When the device driver DSR detects a complete transfer it
will inform higher-level code by invoking the supplied completion
function.
</para>
<para>
This means that the completion function will normally be invoked by a
DSR and not in thread context - although some USB device drivers may
have a different implementation. Therefore the completion function is
restricted in what it can do, in particular it must not make any
calls that will or may block such as locking a mutex or allocating
memory. The kernel documentation should be consulted for more details
of DSR's and interrupt handling generally.
</para>
<para>
It is possible that the completion function will be invoked before
<function>usbs_start_tx_buffer</function> returns. Such an event would
be unusual because the transfer cannot happen until the next time the
host tries to fetch data from this peripheral, but it may happen if,
for example, another interrupt happens and a higher priority thread is
scheduled to run. Also, if the endpoint is currently halted then the
completion function will be invoked immediately with
<literal>-EAGAIN</literal>: typically this will happen in the current
thread rather than in a separate DSR. The completion function is
allowed to start another transfer immediately by calling
<function>usbs_start_tx_buffer</function> again.
</para>
<para>
USB device drivers are not expected to perform any locking. It is the
responsibility of higher-level code to ensure that there is only one
transmit operation for a given endpoint in progress at any one time.
If there are concurrent calls to
<function>usbs_start_tx_buffer</function> then the resulting behaviour
is undefined. For typical USB applications this does not present any
problems because only piece of code will access a given endpoint at
any particular time.
</para>
<para>
The following code fragment illustrates a very simple use of
<function>usbs_start_tx_buffer</function> to implement a blocking
transmit, using a semaphore to synchronise between the foreground
thread and the DSR. For a simple example like this no completion data
is needed.

<para>
Normal USB traffic involves straightforward handshakes, with either an
<literal>ACK</literal> to indicate that a packet was transferred
without errors, or a <literal>NAK</literal> if an error occurred, or
if a peripheral is currently unable to process another packet from the
host, or has no packet to send to the host. There is a third form of
handshake, a <literal>STALL</literal>, which indicates that the
endpoint is currently <emphasis>halted</emphasis>.
</para>
<para>
When an endpoint is halted it means that the host-side code needs to
take some sort of recovery action before communication over that
endpoint can resume. The exact circumstances under which this can
happen are not defined by the USB specification, but one example would
be a protocol violation if say the peripheral attempted to transmit
more data to the host than was permitted by the protocol in use. The
host can use the standard control messages get-status, set-feature and
clear-feature to examine and manipulate the halted status of a given
endpoint. There are USB-specific functions which can be used inside
the peripheral to achieve the same effect. Once an endpoint has been
halted the host can then interact with the peripheral using class or
vendor control messages to perform appropriate recovery, and then the
halted condition can be cleared.
</para>
<para>
Halting an endpoint does not constitute a device state change, and
there is no mechanism by which higher-level code can be informed
immediately. However, any ongoing receive or transmit operations will
be aborted with an <literal>-EAGAIN</literal> error, and any new
receives or transmits will fail immediately with the same error.
</para>
<para>
There are six functions to support halted endpoints, one set for
receive endpoints and another for transmit endpoints, with both sets
behaving in essentially the same way. The first,
<function>usbs_rx_endpoint_halted</function>, can be used to determine
whether or not an endpoint is currently halted: it takes a single
argument that identifies the endpoint of interest. The second
function, <function>usbs_set_rx_endpoint_halted</function>, can be
used to change the halted condition of an endpoint: it takes two
arguments; one to identify the endpoint and another to specify the new
state. The last function
<function>usbs_start_rx_endpoint_wait</function> operates in much the
same way as <function>usbs_start_rx_buffer</function>: when the
endpoint is no longer halted the device driver will invoke the
supplied completion function with a status of 0. The completion
function has the same signature as that for a transfer operation.
Often it will be possible to use a single completion function and have
the foreground code invoke either
<function>usbs_start_rx_buffer</function> or
<function>usbs_start_rx_endpoint_wait</function> depending on the
current state of the endpoint.

<refsect1><title><literal>usbs_control_endpoint</literal> Data Structure</title>
<para>
The device driver for a USB slave device should supply one
<structname>usbs_control_endpoint</structname> data structure per USB
device. This corresponds to endpoint 0 which will be used for all
control message interaction between the host and that device. The data
structure is also used for internal management purposes, for example
to keep track of the current state. In a typical USB peripheral there
will only be one such data structure in the entire system, but if
there are multiple USB slave ports, allowing the peripheral to be
connected to multiple hosts, then there will be a separate data
structure for each one. The name or names of the data structures are
determined by the device drivers. For example, the SA11x0 USB device
driver package provides <literal>usbs_sa11x0_ep0</literal>.
</para>
<para>
The operations on a control endpoint do not fit cleanly into a
conventional open/read/write I/O model. For example, when the host
sends a control message to the USB peripheral this may be one of four
types: standard, class, vendor and reserved. Some or all of the
standard control messages will be handled automatically by the common
USB slave package or by the device driver itself. Other standard
control messages and the other types of control messages may be
handled by a class-specific package or by application code. Although
it would be possible to have devtab entries such as
<literal>/dev/usbs_ep0/standard</literal> and
<literal>/dev/usbs_ep0/class</literal>, and then support read and
write operations on these devtab entries, this would add significant
overhead and code complexity. Instead, all of the fields in the
control endpoint data structure are public and can be manipulated
directly by higher level code if and when required. 
</para>
<para>
Control endpoints involve a number of callback functions, with
higher-level code installing suitable function pointers in the control
endpoint data structure. For example, if the peripheral involves
vendor-specific control messages then a suitable handler for these
messages should be installed. Although the exact details depend on the
device driver, typically these callback functions will be invoked at
DSR level rather than thread level. Therefore, only certain eCos
functions can be invoked; specifically, those functions that are
guaranteed not to block. If a potentially blocking function such as a
semaphore wait or a mutex lock operation is invoked from inside the
callback then the resulting behaviour is undefined, and the system as
a whole may fail. In addition, if one of the callback functions
involves significant processing effort then this may adversely affect
the system's real time characteristics. The eCos kernel documentation
should be consulted for more details of DSR handling.
</para>

<refsect2><title>Initialization</title>
<para>
The <structname>usbs_control_endpoint</structname> data structure
contains the following fields related to initialization.
</para>
<programlisting width=72>
typedef struct usbs_control_endpoint {
    &hellip;
    const usbs_enumeration_data* enumeration_data;
    void                         (*start_fn)(usbs_control_endpoint*);
    &hellip;
};
</programlisting>
<para>
It is the responsibility of higher-level code, usually the
application, to define the USB enumeration data. This needs to be
installed in the control endpoint data structure early on during
system startup, before the USB device is actually started and any
interaction with the host is possible. Details of the enumeration data
are supplied in the section <link linkend="usbs-enum">USB Enumeration
Data</link>. Typically, the enumeration data is constant for a given
peripheral, although it can be constructed dynamically if necessary.
However, the enumeration data cannot change while the peripheral is
connected to a host: the peripheral cannot easily claim to be a
keyboard one second and a printer the next.
</para>
<para>
The <structfield>start_fn</structfield> member is normally accessed
via the utility <link
linkend="usbs-start"><function>usbs_start</function></link> rather
than directly. It is provided by the device driver and should be
invoked once the system is fully initialized and interaction with the
host is possible. A typical implementation would change the USB data
pins from tristated to active. If the peripheral is already plugged
into a host then the latter should detect this change and start
interacting with the peripheral, including requesting the enumeration
data.

<para>
The USB standard defines a number of states for a given USB
peripheral. The initial state is <emphasis>detached</emphasis>, where
the peripheral is either not connected to a host at all or, from the
host's perspective, the peripheral has not started up yet because the
relevant pins are tristated. The peripheral then moves via
intermediate <emphasis>attached</emphasis> and
<emphasis>powered</emphasis> states to its default or
<emphasis>reset</emphasis> state, at which point the host and
peripheral can actually start exchanging data. The first message is
from host to peripheral and provides a unique 7-bit address within the
local USB network, resulting in a state change to
<emphasis>addressed</emphasis>. The host then requests enumeration
data and performs other initialization. If everything succeeds the
host sends a standard set-configuration control message, after which
the peripheral is <emphasis>configured</emphasis> and expected to be
up and running. Note that some USB device drivers may be unable to
distinguish between the <emphasis>detached</emphasis>,
<emphasis>attached</emphasis> and <emphasis>powered</emphasis> states
but generally this is not important to higher-level code.
</para>
<para>
A USB host should generate at least one token every millisecond. If a
peripheral fails to detect any USB traffic for a period of time then
typically this indicates that the host has entered a power-saving
mode, and the peripheral should do the same if possible. This
corresponds to the <emphasis>suspended</emphasis> bit. The actual
state is a combination of <emphasis>suspended</emphasis> and the
previous state, for example <emphasis>configured</emphasis> and
<emphasis>suspended</emphasis> rather than just
<emphasis>suspended</emphasis>. When the peripheral subsequently
detects USB traffic it would switch back to the
<emphasis>configured</emphasis> state.
</para>
<para>
The USB device driver and the common USB slave package will maintain
the current state in the control endpoint's
<structfield>state</structfield> field. There should be no need for
any other code to change this field, but it can be examined whenever
appropriate. In addition whenever a state change occurs the generic
code can invoke a state change callback function. By default, no such
callback function will be installed. Some class-specific packages such
as the USB-ethernet package will install a suitable function to keep
track of whether or not the host-peripheral connection is up, that is
whether or not ethernet packets can be exchanged. Application code can
also update this field. If multiple parties want to be informed of
state changes, for example both a class-specific package and
application code, then typically the application code will install its
state change handler after the class-specific package and is
responsible for chaining into the package's handler.
</para>
<para>
The state change callback function is invoked with four arguments. The
first identifies the control endpoint. The second is an arbitrary
pointer: higher-level code can fill in the
<structfield>state_change_data</structfield> field to set this. The
third argument specifies the state change that has occurred, and the
last argument supplies the previous state (the new state is readily
available from the control endpoint structure).
</para>
<para>
eCos does not provide any utility functions for updating or examining
the <structfield>state_change_fn</structfield> or
<structfield>state_change_data</structfield> fields. Instead, it is
expected that the fields in the
<structname>usbs_control_endpoint</structname> data structure will be
manipulated directly. Any utility functions would do just this, but
at the cost of increased code and cpu overheads.

When a USB peripheral is connected to the host it must always respond
to control messages sent to endpoint 0. Control messages always
consist of an initial eight-byte header, containing fields such as a
request type. This may be followed by a further data transfer, either
from host to peripheral or from peripheral to host. The way this is
handled is described in the <link
linkend="usbs-control-buffer">Buffer Management</link> section below.
</para>
<para>
The USB device driver will always accept the initial eight-byte
header, storing it in the <structfield>control_buffer</structfield>
field. Then it determines the request type: standard, class, vendor,
or reserved. The way in which the last three of these are processed is
described in the section <link linkend="usbs-control-other">Other
Control Messages</link>. Some
standard control messages will be handled by the device driver itself;
typically the <emphasis>set-address</emphasis> request and the
<emphasis>get-status</emphasis>, <emphasis>set-feature</emphasis> and
<emphasis>clear-feature</emphasis> requests when applied to endpoints.
</para>
<para>
If a standard control message cannot be handled by the device driver
itself, the driver checks the
<structfield>standard_control_fn</structfield> field in the control
endpoint data structure. If higher-level code has installed a suitable
callback function then this will be invoked with two argument, the
control endpoint data structure itself and the
<structfield>standard_control_data</structfield> field. The latter
allows the higher level code to associate arbitrary data with the
control endpoint. The callback function can return one of three
values: <emphasis>HANDLED</emphasis> to indicate that the request has
been processed; <emphasis>UNKNOWN</emphasis> if the message should be
handled by the default code; or <emphasis>STALL</emphasis> to indicate
an error condition. If higher level code has not installed a callback
function or if the callback function has returned
<emphasis>UNKNOWN</emphasis> then the device driver will invoke a
default handler, <function>usbs_handle_standard_control</function>
provided by the common USB slave package.
</para>
<para>
The default handler can cope with all of the standard control messages
for a simple USB peripheral. However, if the peripheral involves
multiple configurations, multiple interfaces in a configuration, or
alternate settings for an interface, then this cannot be handled by
generic code. For example, a multimedia peripheral may support various
alternate settings for a given data source with different bandwidth
requirements, and the host can select a setting that takes into
account the current load. Clearly higher-level code needs to be aware
when the host changes the current setting, so that it can adjust the
rate at which data is fed to or retrieved from the host. Therefore the
higher-level code needs to install its own standard control callback
and process appropriate messages, rather than leaving these to the
default handler.
</para>
<para>
The default handler will take care of the
<emphasis>get-descriptor</emphasis> request used to obtain the
enumeration data. It has support for string descriptors but ignores
language encoding issues. If language encoding is important for the
peripheral then this will have to be handled by an
application-specific standard control handler.
</para>
<para>
The header file <filename
class="headerfile">&lt;cyg/io/usb/usb.h&gt;</filename> defines various
constants related to control messages, for example the function codes
corresponding to the standard request types. This header file is
provided by the common USB package, not by the USB slave package,
since the information is also relevant to USB hosts.

Non-standard control messages always have to be processed by

the USB-ethernet package will handle requests for getting the MAC

the device driver will store the initial request in the
<structfield>control_buffer</structfield> field, check for an
appropriate handler, and invoke it with details of the control
endpoint and any handler-specific data that has been installed
alongside the handler itself. The handler should return either

Many USB control messages involve transferring more data than just the
initial eight-byte header. The header indicates the direction of the
transfer, OUT for host to peripheral or IN for peripheral to host.
It also specifies a length field, which is exact for an OUT transfer
or an upper bound for an IN transfer. Control message handlers can
manipulate six fields within the control endpoint data structure to
ensure that the transfer happens correctly.
</para>
<para>
For an OUT transfer, the handler should examine the length field in
the header and provide a single buffer for all the data. A
class-specific protocol would typically impose an upper bound on the
amount of data, allowing the buffer to be allocated statically.
The handler should update the <structfield>buffer</structfield> and
<structfield>complete_fn</structfield> fields. When all the data has
been transferred the completion callback will be invoked, and its
return value determines the response sent back to the host. The USB
standard allows for a new control message to be sent before the
current transfer has completed, effectively cancelling the current
operation. When this happens the completion function will also be
invoked. The second argument to the completion function specifies what
has happened, with a value of 0 indicating success and an error code
such as <literal>-EPIPE</literal> or <literal>-EIO</literal>
indicating that the current transfer has been cancelled.
</para>
<para>
IN transfers are a little bit more complicated. The required
information, for example the enumeration data, may not be in a single
contiguous buffer. Instead a mechanism is provided by which the buffer
can be refilled, thus allowing the transfer to move from one record to
the next. Essentially, the transfer operates as follows:
</para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
When the host requests another chunk of data (typically eight bytes),
the USB device driver will examine the
<structfield>buffer_size</structfield> field. If non-zero then
<structfield>buffer</structfield> contains at least one more byte of
data, and then <structfield>buffer_size</structfield> is decremented.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
When <structfield>buffer_size</structfield> has dropped to 0, the
<structfield>fill_buffer_fn</structfield> field will be examined. If
non-null it will be invoked to refill the buffer.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
The <structfield>fill_data</structfield> and
<structfield>fill_index</structfield> fields are not used by the
device driver. Instead these fields are available to the refill
function to keep track of the current state of the transfer.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
When <structfield>buffer_size</structfield> is 0 and
<structfield>fill_buffer_fn</structfield> is NULL, no more data is
available and the transfer has completed.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
Optionally a completion function can be installed. This will be
invoked with 0 if the transfer completes successfully, or with an
error code if the transfer is cancelled because of another control
messsage. 
</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<para>
If the requested data is contiguous then the only fields that need
to be manipulated are <structfield>buffer</structfield> and
<structfield>buffer_size</structfield>, and optionally
<structfield>complete_fn</structfield>. If the requested data is not
contiguous then the initial control message handler should update
<structfield>fill_buffer_fn</structfield> and some or all of the other
fields, as required. An example of this is the handling of the
standard <emphasis>get-descriptor</emphasis> control message by
<function>usbs_handle_standard_control</function>.
</para>

</programlisting>
<para>
In nearly all circumstances USB I/O should be interrupt-driven.
However, there are special environments such as RedBoot where polled
operation may be appropriate. If the device driver can operate in
polled mode then it will provide a suitable function via the
<structfield>poll_fn</structfield> field, and higher-level code can
invoke this regularly. This polling function will take care of all
endpoints associated with the device, not just the control endpoint.
If the USB hardware involves a single interrupt vector then this will
be identified in the data structure as well.

<refsect1><title>Receive and Transmit Data Structures</title>
<para>
In addition to a single <structname>usbs_control_endpoint</structname>
data structure per USB slave device, the USB device driver should also
provide receive and transmit data structures corresponding to the
other endpoints. The names of these are determined by the device
driver. For example, the SA1110 USB device driver package provides
<literal>usbs_sa11x0_ep1</literal> for receives and
<literal>usbs_sa11x0_ep2</literal> for transmits.
</para>
<para>
Unlike control endpoints, the common USB slave package does provide a
number of utility routines to manipulate data endpoints. For example
<link
linkend="usbs-start-rx"><function>usbs_start_rx_buffer</function></link>
can be used to receive data from the host into a buffer. In addition
the USB device driver can provide devtab entries such as
<literal>/dev/usbs1r</literal> and <literal>/dev/usbs2w</literal>, so
higher-level code can <function>open</function> these devices and then
perform blocking <function>read</function> and
<function>write</function> operations.
</para>
<para>
However, the operation of data endpoints and the various
endpoint-related functions is relatively straightforward. First
consider a <structname>usbs_rx_endpoint</structname> structure. The
device driver will provide the members
<structfield>start_rx_fn</structfield> and
<structfield>set_halted_fn</structfield>, and it will maintain the
<structfield>halted</structfield> field. To receive data, higher-level
code sets the <structfield>buffer</structfield>,
<structfield>buffer_size</structfield>,
<structfield>complete_fn</structfield> and optionally the
<structfield>complete_data</structfield> fields. Next the
<structfield>start_rx_fn</structfield> member should be called. When
the transfer has finished the device driver will invoke the completion
function, using <structfield>complete_data</structfield> as the first
argument and a size field for the second argument. A negative size
indicates an error of some sort: <literal>-EGAIN</literal> indicates
that the endpoint has been halted, usually at the request of the host;
<literal>-EPIPE</literal> indicates that the connection between the
host and the peripheral has been broken. Certain device drivers may
generate other error codes.
</para>
<para>
If higher-level code needs to halt or unhalt an endpoint then it can
invoke the <structfield>set_halted_fn</structfield> member. When an
endpoint is halted, invoking <structfield>start_rx_fn</structfield>
wit <structfield>buffer_size</structfield> set to 0 indicates that
higher-level code wants to block until the endpoint is no longer
halted; at that point the completion function will be invoked.
</para>
<para>
USB device drivers are allowed to assume that higher-level protocols
ensure that host and peripheral agree on the amount of data that will
be transferred, or at least on an upper bound. Therefore there is no
need for the device driver to maintain its own buffers, and copy
operations are avoided. If the host sends more data than expected then
the resulting behaviour is undefined.
</para>
<para>
Transmit endpoints work in essentially the same way as receive
endpoints. Higher-level code should set the
<structfield>buffer</structfield> and
<structfield>buffer_size</structfield> fields to point at the data to
be transferred, then call <structfield>start_tx_fn</structfield>, and
the device driver will invoked the completion function when the
transfer has completed.
</para>
<para>
USB device drivers are not expected to perform any locking. If at any
time there are two concurrent receive operations for a given endpoint,
or two concurrent transmit operations, then the resulting behaviour is
undefined. It is the responsibility of higher-level code to perform
any synchronisation that may be necessary. In practice, conflicts are
unlikely because typically a given endpoint will only be accessed
sequentially by just one part of the overall system.

<refsect1><title>Introduction</title>
<para>
Often the best way to write a USB device driver will be to start with
an existing one and modify it as necessary. The information given here
is intended primarily as an outline rather than as a complete guide.
</para>
<note>
<para>
At the time of writing only one USB device driver has been
implemented. Hence it is possible, perhaps probable, that some
portability issues have not yet been addressed. One issue
involves the different types of transfer, for example the initial
target hardware had no support for isochronous or interrupt transfers,
so additional functionality may be needed to switch between transfer
types. Another issue would be hardware where a given endpoint number,
say endpoint 1, could be used for either receiving or transmitting
data, but not both because a single fifo is used. Issues like these
will have to be resolved as and when additional USB device drivers are
written.
</para>
</note>
</refsect1>

<refsect1><title>The Control Endpoint</title>
<para>
A USB device driver should provide a single <link
linkend="usbs-control"><structname>usbs_control_endpoint</structname></link>
data structure for every USB device. Typical peripherals will have
only one USB port so there will be just one such data structure in the
entire system, but theoretically it is possible to have multiple USB
devices. These may all involve the same chip, in which case a single
device driver should support multiple device instances, or they may
involve different chips. The name or names of these data structures
are determined by the device driver, but appropriate care should be
taken to avoid name clashes. 
</para>
<para>
A USB device cannot be used unless the control endpoint data structure
exists. However, the presence of USB hardware in the target processor
or board does not guarantee that the application will necessarily want
to use that hardware. To avoid unwanted code or data overheads, the
device driver can provide a configuration option to determine whether
or not the endpoint 0 data structure is actually provided. A default
value of <literal>CYGINT_IO_USB_SLAVE_CLIENTS</literal> ensures that
the USB driver will be enabled automatically if higher-level code does
require USB support, while leaving ultimate control to the user.
</para>
<para>
The USB device driver is responsible for filling in the
<structfield>start_fn</structfield>,
<structfield>poll_fn</structfield> and
<structfield>interrupt_vector</structfield> fields. Usually this can
be achieved by static initialization. The driver is also largely
responsible for maintaining the <structfield>state</structfield>
field. The <structfield>control_buffer</structfield> array should be
used to hold the first packet of a control message. The
<structfield>buffer</structfield> and other fields related to data
transfers will be managed <link
linkend="usbs-control-buffer">jointly</link> by higher-level code and
the device driver. The remaining fields are generally filled in by
higher-level code, although the driver should initialize them to NULL
values.
</para>
<para>
Hardware permitting, the USB device should be inactive until the
<structfield>start_fn</structfield> is invoked, for example by
tristating the appropriate pins. This prevents the host from
interacting with the peripheral before all other parts of the system
have initialized. It is expected that the
<structfield>start_fn</structfield> will only be invoked once, shortly
after power-up.
</para>
<para>
Where possible the device driver should detect state changes, such as
when the connection between host and peripheral is established, and
<link linkend="usbs-control-state">report</link> these to higher-level
code via the <structfield>state_change_fn</structfield> callback, if
any. The state change to and from configured state cannot easily be
handled by the device driver itself, instead higher-level code such as
the common USB slave package will take care of this.
</para>
<para>
Once the connection between host and peripheral has been established,
the peripheral must be ready to accept control messages at all times,
and must respond to these within certain time constraints. For
example, the standard set-address control message must be handled
within 50ms. The USB specification provides more information on these
constraints. The device driver is responsible for receiving the
initial packet of a control message. This packet will always be eight
bytes and should be stored in the
<structfield>control_buffer</structfield> field. Certain standard
control messages should be detected and handled by the device driver
itself. The most important is set-address, but usually the get-status,
set-feature and clear-feature requests when applied to halted
endpoints should also be handled by the driver. Other standard control
messages should first be passed on to the
<structfield>standard_control_fn</structfield> callback (if any), and
finally to the default handler
<function>usbs_handle_standard_control</function> provided by the
common USB slave package. Class, vendor and reserved control messages
should always be dispatched to the appropriate callback and there is
no default handler for these.
</para>
<para>
Some control messages will involve further data transfer, not just the
initial packet. The device driver must handle this in accordance with
the USB specification and the <link
linkend="usbs-control-buffer">buffer management strategy</link>. The
driver is also responsible for keeping track of whether or not the
control operation has succeeded and generating an ACK or STALL
handshake. 
</para>
<para>
The polling support is optional and may not be feasible on all
hardware. It is only used in certain specialised environments such as
RedBoot. A typical implementation of the polling function would just
check whether or not an interrupt would have occurred and, if so, call
the same code that the interrupt handler would.
</para>
</refsect1>

<refsect1><title>Data Endpoints</title>
<para>
In addition to the control endpoint data structure, a USB device
driver should also provide appropriate <link linkend="usbs-data">data
endpoint</link> data structures. Obviously this is only relevant if
the USB support generally is desired, that is if the control endpoint is
provided. In addition, higher-level code may not require all the
endpoints, so it may be useful to provide configuration options that
control the presence of each endpoint. For example, the intended
application might only involve a single transmit endpoint and of
course control messages, so supporting receive endpoints might waste
memory.
</para>
<para>
Conceptually, data endpoints are much simpler than the control
endpoint. The device driver has to supply two functions, one for
data transfers and another to control the halted condition. These
implement the functionality for
<link linkend="usbs-start-rx"><function>usbs_start_rx_buffer</function></link>,
<link linkend="usbs-start-tx"><function>usbs_start_tx_buffer</function></link>,
<link linkend="usbs-halt"><function>usbs_set_rx_endpoint_halted</function></link> and
<link linkend="usbs-halt"><function>usbs_set_tx_endpoint_halted</function></link>.
The device driver is also responsible for maintaining the
<structfield>halted</structfield> status.
</para>
<para>
For data transfers, higher-level code will have filled in the
<structfield>buffer</structfield>,
<structfield>buffer_size</structfield>,
<structfield>complete_fn</structfield> and
<structfield>complete_data</structfield> fields. The transfer function
should arrange for the transfer to start, allowing the host to send or
receive packets. Typically this will result in an interrupt at the end
of the transfer or after each packet. Once the entire transfer has
been completed, the driver's interrupt handling code should invoke the
completion function. This can happen either in DSR context or thread
context, depending on the driver's implementation. There are a number
of special cases to consider. If the endpoint is halted when the
transfer is started then the completion function can be invoked
immediately with <literal>-EAGAIN</literal>. If the transfer cannot be
completed because the connection is broken then the completion
function should be invoked with <literal>-EPIPE</literal>. If the
endpoint is stalled during the transfer, either because of a standard
control message or because higher-level code calls the appropriate
<structfield>set_halted_fn</structfield>, then again the completion
function should be invoked with <literal>-EAGAIN</literal>. Finally,
the <<function>usbs_start_rx_endpoint_wait</function> and
<function>usbs_start_tx_endpoint_wait</function> functions involve
calling the device driver's data transfer function with a buffer size
of 0 bytes.
</para>
</refsect1>

<refsect1><title>Devtab Entries</title>
<para>
For some applications or higher-level packages it may be more
convenient to use traditional open/read/write I/O calls rather than
the non-blocking USB I/O calls. To support this the device driver can
provide a devtab entry for each endpoint, for example:
</para>
<programlisting width=72>
#ifdef CYGVAR_DEVS_USB_SA11X0_EP1_DEVTAB_ENTRY

static CHAR_DEVIO_TABLE(usbs_sa11x0_ep1_devtab_functions,
                        &amp;cyg_devio_cwrite,
                        &amp;usbs_devtab_cread,
                        &amp;cyg_devio_bwrite,
                        &amp;cyg_devio_bread,
                        &amp;cyg_devio_select,
                        &amp;cyg_devio_get_config,
                        &amp;cyg_devio_set_config);

static CHAR_DEVTAB_ENTRY(usbs_sa11x0_ep1_devtab_entry,
                         CYGDAT_DEVS_USB_SA11X0_DEVTAB_BASENAME "1r",
                         0,
                         &amp;usbs_sa11x0_ep1_devtab_functions,
                         &amp;usbs_sa11x0_devtab_dummy_init,
                         0,
                         (void*) &amp;usbs_sa11x0_ep1);
#endif
</programlisting>
<para>
Again care must be taken to avoid name clashes. This can be achieved
by having a configuration option to control the base name, with a
default value of e.g. <literal>/dev/usbs</literal>, and appending an
endpoint-specific string. This gives the application developer
sufficient control to eliminate any name clashes. The common USB slave
package provides functions <function>usbs_devtab_cwrite</function> and
<function>usbs_devtab_cread</function>, which can be used in the
function tables for transmit and receive endpoints respectively. The
private field <structfield>priv</structfield> of the devtab entry
should be a pointer to the underlying endpoint data structure.
</para>
<para>
Because devtab entries are never accessed directly, only indirectly,
they would usually be eliminated by the linker. To avoid this the
devtab entries should normally be defined in a separate source file
which ends up the special library <filename>libextras.a</filename>
rather than in the default library <filename>libtarget.a</filename>.
</para>
<para>
Not all applications or higher-level packages will want to use the
devtab entries and the blocking I/O facilities. It may be appropriate
for the device driver to provide additional configuration options that
control whether or not any or all of the devtab entries should be
provided, to avoid unnecessary memory overheads.
</para>
</refsect1>

<refsect1><title>Interrupt Handling</title>
<para>
A typical USB device driver will need to service interrupts for all of
the endpoints and possibly for additional USB events such as entering
or leaving suspended mode. Usually these interrupts need not be
serviced directly by the ISR. Instead, they can be left to a DSR. If
the peripheral is not able to accept or send another packet just yet,
the hardware will generate a NAK and the host will just retry a little
bit later. If high throughput is required then it may be desirable to
handle the bulk transfer protocol largely at ISR level, that is take
care of each packet in the ISR and only activate the DSR once the
whole transfer has completed.
</para>
<para>
Control messages may involve invoking arbitrary callback functions in
higher-level code. This should normally happen at DSR level. Doing it
at ISR level could seriously affect the system's interrupt latency and
impose unacceptable constraints on what operations can be performed by
those callbacks. If the device driver requires a thread anyway then it
may be appropriate to use this thread for invoking the callbacks, but
usually it is not worthwhile to add a new thread to the system just
for this; higher-level code is expected to write callbacks that
function sensibly at DSR level. Much the same applies to the
completion functions associated with data transfers. These should also
be invoked at DSR or thread level.
</para>
