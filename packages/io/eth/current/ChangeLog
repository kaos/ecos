2000-09-28  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/net/eth_drv.c (eth_drv_run_deliveries): Remove race
	condition; a chance to deliver could be delayed until "next time"
	if the DSR snuck in just right.

2000-09-14  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* cdl/eth_drivers.cdl: Add configury to control new features.  All
	is controlled globally by CYGPKG_IO_ETH_DRIVERS_SIMULATED_FAILURES
	which is by default off, natch.

	* src/net/eth_drv.c (simulate_fail): Implement simulated failures
	in ethernet packet delivery - independent tx and rx dropping and
	rx packet corruption.  Also a "line break" drop-all feature.

2000-09-13  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/stand_alone/eth_drv.c: Take out noisy dump when out of buffers.

2000-09-11  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/stand_alone/eth_drv.c (eth_drv_write): If we timeout waiting
	for the write to complete, do reset the vectors to point to the
	application, rather just a bald "return".

2000-09-08  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/netdev.h (NETDEVTAB_ENTRY): Work around feature of new
	version of CYG_HAL_TABLE_ENTRY() whereby no spaces are allowed.

2000-09-07  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/netdev.h (cyg_netdevtab_entry_t): Correct syntax for
	CYG_HAL_TABLE_TYPE

2000-09-04  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/netdev.h (cyg_netdevtab_entry_t): Apply CYG_HAL_TABLE_TYPE

2000-09-01  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/stand_alone/eth_drv.c (eth_drv_dsr): New function, never
	called but maybe referenced in stand_alone context, which lets
	redboot work in the new world.

2000-09-01  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* OVERVIEW: This is part of the change to the network stack to
	greatly reduce latencies both of (other) DSRs and of thread
	scheduling.  All the work that the network stack *and* individual
	ether drivers used to do in DSRs (including alarm callbacks and
	data copies to/from the device memory) is moved into a "fast
	network thread" instead.  It calls a device's "deliver" function
	to do the work that was previously in the DSR.  This is a separate
	thread so that it can be set higher priority than application
	threads in order to minimize packet loss (depending on the
	driver), if required (the application threads presumed to be
	higher priority in turn than the network thread).  A crucial
	consequence of this is that we are no longer locking against DSRs,
	so a plain mutex can be used rather than the global scheduler
	lock, thus simplifying all the splfoo/splx() style functions.

	These changes WILL BREAK individual device drivers until they are
	updated AND the standalone logical ether driver in this component,
	until it is updated also.

	* include/eth_drv.h (ETH_DRV_SC): Add "deliver" entry to struct
	eth_hwr_funs interface record; declare available DSR and flag for
	"needs delivery" in SC status field.

	* src/net/eth_drv.c (eth_drv_run_deliveries): New function,
	performs callbacks to deliver funcs for all devs that want it.
	(eth_drv_dsr): New function, sets flag in sc and calls up to net
	stack to schedule the fast network thread.
	(eth_drv_send): No need to lock scheduler here.

2000-08-29  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/stand_alone/eth_drv.c: Use null buffer, (char *)0,
	instead of wasting memory - low level drivers must be designed
	to handle this case.

2000-08-28  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/stand_alone/eth_drv.c: Use new configuration parameters.

	* cdl/eth_drivers.cdl: Add new configury to control number of
	internal buffers used by this layer.  Also exposed some of the
	debug flags here.

2000-08-25  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/eth_drv_stats.h (ether_drv_stats): A little further
	diddling; have a bool to say whether the dot3 info is filled in.

2000-08-24  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/net/eth_drv.c (eth_drv_ioctl): Implement ioctl() calls.
	sockio.h numbers SIOCGIFSTATS and SIOCGIFSTATSUD map to
	ETH_DRV_GET_IF_STATS and ETH_DRV_GET_IF_STATS_UD respectively.

	* include/eth_drv.h (ETH_DRV_GET_IF_STATS_UD): Add new device
	interface ioctl() numbers, to get the struct below filled in.
	Also pull in the definition include file (below).

	* include/eth_drv_stats.h (ether_drv_stats): New file: Define
	common structure for ether devices to return stats info to higher
	up, via an ioctl() call.  SNMP uses this.

2000-08-23  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/stand_alone/eth_drv.c: 
	* include/eth_drv.h: Low level drivers now need to export a 
	function which returns the interrupt vector used by that interface.
	This allows outside code to determine this in a portable fashion.

2000-08-16  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/stand_alone/eth_drv.c: 
	* include/eth_drv.h: Clean up warnings (better protyping).

	* src/stand_alone/eth_drv.c (eth_drv_write): Abandon sending
	packet if device goes not ready for a long time (in some cases,
	this is the only indication that the link is down).

2000-08-07  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/net/eth_drv.c (eth_drv_recv): Add safety in case this gets
	called [from stand-alone code] while interface is not up.
	
	* src/stand_alone/eth_drv.c: 
	* include/eth_drv.h: Rework to more fully support mixed stand-alone
	and system (eCos) stacks.

2000-08-03  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/eth_drivers.cdl: Reparent within I/O, not NET.  This allows
	for stand-alone use as well as support for other stack implementations.

2000-07-28  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/eth_drv.c (eth_drv_recv): Assert that the length we're asked
	to deal with is at least an ether header, and also be defensive in
	any case; discard small packets.  [CASE 104206]

2000-07-26  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/eth_drv.c: 
	* include/eth_drv.h: Change interfaces used by hardware layer to
	be "soft" (pointers to functions).  This will allow those drivers
	to be shared by applications and the ROM/debug environment.

2000-07-15  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/eth_drv.h: Add [initial] extensions to let this
	layer work either in an eCos environment or stand-alone.

2000-07-11  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/eth_drv.h: Add minimal PCMCIA support.

	* src/eth_drv.c (eth_drv_netdev): New function - used to find the
	ethernet device info for PCMCIA devices.

2000-06-23  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/eth_drv.c (eth_drv_send): Do not consume an SG entry for
	zero length data; tolerate overflow of the SG.  Before this, pings
	of 6000 bytes crashed the system!

	You can now set net_debug to 2 to get quieter output; 1 gives the
	whole packet dump as before.

	* include/eth_drv.h (MAX_ETH_DRV_SG): Make this 16 so that an MTU
	made of all mbufs will not overflow.

2000-03-28  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/eth_drv.c (eth_drv_recv): Tolerate running out of MBUFs
	instead of "panic"ing.

2000-03-08  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/eth_drv.c: Add some function [block] comments.
	(eth_drv_send): Use eCos scheduler lock instead of interrupt lock.

2000-03-08  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* doc/driver_doc: Add some clarification about what's called when,
	proofreading results, shorter lines so I can print it nicely.

2000-03-06  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/eth_drv.c: 
	* include/eth_drv.h: 
	* doc/driver_doc: Remove generic "priv"ate references.

2000-02-29  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/eth_drv.c: 
	* include/eth_drv.h: New expanded API for hardware drivers.

2000-02-18  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/eth_drv.c (eth_drv_send): Disable interrupts while initiating
	the buffer send - avoid a possible race.

2000-02-08  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/eth_drivers.cdl:
	Reparent under CYGPKG_NET and tidy display strings.
