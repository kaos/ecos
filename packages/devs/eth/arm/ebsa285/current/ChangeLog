	* tests/test_net_realtime.h (tnr_print_activity): New routine to
	check the system is working, tidied up the API.  It works!

2000-05-11  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/ebsa285_eth_drivers.cdl: Added export of the test header
	below, and config opts for controlling EEPROM writing and all the
	status chatter as the device starts up.

	* src/if_ebsa285.c: Reworked the code for reading and setting the
	EEPROM that holds the MAC address.  This is very ugly, but now
	more reliable.  Also tidied up printing cruft with neater
	configury, and made it an option (for safety) whether it's
	possible to write the EEPROM at all.

	* tests/test_net_realtime.h: New file - it is intended to be used
	by networking tests to verify that latency is not compromised by
	the stack and driver.  It's very platform specific, hence the
	location in here.  This is a preliminary version only.

2000-04-27  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/if_ebsa285.c: A serious re-write.  This cuts out a lot of
	code from the old version and improves the performance greatly.

	The cruft was mainly doing lots of explicit event communication
	between the ISR and DSR, when in fact all the state needed is
	present in the tx/rx rings.  So both ISRs and DSRs regard their
	call as an opportunity to progress everything they can, rather
	than only dealing with one interrupt cause at a time; the
	connection between them is now rather looser.

	Interrups can now be re-enabled after the ISR (in other words they
	are not masked in the ISR), no need to wait for the DSR, but in
	consequence some DSR code must mask/unmask intrs as it works.

	The 82559 appears to be a little slow in reacting to commands and
	state changes, so some interrupts were being lost - or persisting
	beyond their desired life - so there's some kinda polling code to
	deal with that also.  We also rely on the foreground to kind of
	poll in the same way, in the send/can_send calls - we know the
	stack will re-try if necessary, though this is rare.

	The driver now works (albeit at much reduced performance) with as
	few as 6 rx and tx buffers - in other words the "queue full/out of
	rx buffers" states have been tested and all is well.  It works
	generally fine with 8 buffers of each kind.

	The mux ISR and DSR are now rather more polled than the old
	versions; we just try to do things with both devices (if active)
	by simply calling each unitary ISR/DSR respectively.

	I also re-ordered some of the code, moving utilities to the end of
	the file and grouping together Tx and Rx machines a bit better.

	* src/if_ebsa285.c: Attribution to Ron Spence, Pacific Softworks
	added as a contributor.

2000-04-07  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* ecos.db: Re-organize device packages.  This is a massive change
	involving deleting all the sources for serial and ethernet drivers
	from where they used to live in
	    packages/io/serial/current/src/ARCH/PLATFORM.[ch]
	    packages/net/drivers/eth/PLATFORM/current/src/...
	and reinstating them in
	    packages/devs/serial/ARCH/PLATFORM/current/src/...
	    packages/devs/eth/ARCH/PLATFORM/current/src/...

	All these new packages are properly defined in ecos.db, and are
	all of type "hardware" so that a "target" can grab them.
	
	This directory layout is descriptive of the devices we have right
	now, arch and platform are separate levels just to make it easier
	to navigate in the filesystem and similar to the HAL structure in
	the filesystem.

	It is *not* prescriptive of future work; for example, the mythical
	common highly-portable 16550 serial driver which works on many
	targets would be called "devs/serial/s16550/current", or a serial
	device for a particular board (cogent springs to mind) that can
	work with different CPUs fitted is "devs/serial/cogent/current".

	Changelogs have been preserved and replicated over all the new
	packages, so that no history is lost.

	The contents of individual source files are unchanged; they build
	in just the same emvironment except for a very few cases where the
	config file name changed in this movement.

	Targets in ecos.db have been redefined to bring in all relevant
	hardware packages including net and serial drivers (but the newly
	included packages are only active if their desired parent is
	available.)
	
	The names of CDL options (and their #defines of course) stay the
	same for the serial drivers, for backward compatibility.

	* templates/*/current.ect: these have had CYGPKG_IO_SERIAL added
	rather than it being in (almost) all target definitions.
	
2000-03-29  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/if_ebsa285.c (i82559_recv): Be happy with NULLs in the
	SGlist; it means the caller is out of memory so drop the packet on
	the floor.  Also remove a completely redundant test.

2000-03-06  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/if_ebsa285.c (i82559_can_send): Update net driver to new
	interface style.  This is incomplete wrt promiscuous mode, but
	that's probably about all.

2000-02-14  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/ebsa285_eth_drivers.cdl: Update CDL to indicate multiple 
	interface support.

2000-02-14  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/if_ebsa285.c (pci_init_find_82559s): Tidy comments somewhat
	and set debug and stats collecting defines to most friendly
	settings.

2000-02-10  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/if_ebsa285.c (PacketRxReady): Fix bug; current descriptor
	was not being write back for the callback to use.  Hence asserts
	on state of rfd were firing in busy times - that leading rfd had
	already been drained.

	Also rationalized meaning of DEBUG printy symbols a bit - it's now
	chatty during startup/foreground manipulations but not in any
	performance related activities ie. rx or tx.

2000-02-09  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/ebsa285_eth_drivers.cdl:

	Reparent under CYGPKG_NET_ETH_DRIVERS and tidy display strings.

2000-02-08  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/if_ebsa285.c: New File.
	* cdl/ebsa285_eth_drivers.cdl: New File.

	Initial Checkin of EBSA285 Ethernet driver.

	It's one monolithic file at present, and should be split up into a
	more generic Intel 82559 driver plus platform-specific parts (PCI
	et al) plus eCos/Red-Hat-BSD-stack parts.
