    * cdl/can_loop.cd: Changed naming of various options from 
      xxx_IO_CAN_LOOP into xxx_DEVS_CAN_LOOP

2007-03-23  Uwe Kindler  <uwe_kindler@web.de>

	* cdl/can_loop.cdl: Driver now implements the interfaces
	  CYGINT_IO_CAN_TX_EVENTS, CYGINT_IO_CAN_STD_CAN_ID, 
	  CYGINT_IO_CAN_EXT_CAN_ID.
	  Removed CYGPKG_IO_CAN_LOOP_CFLAGS_ADD and 
	  CYGPKG_IO_CAN_LOOP_CFLAGS_REMOVE because they had no function.
	  
	* src/loop_can.c: Added missing function loop_can_get_config
	  to make the driver build properly.
	
	* tests: Did some fixes and cleanups for all test cases to make them
	  work properly with the changes in the CAN I/O layer.
