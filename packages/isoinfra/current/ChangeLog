2000-10-05  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/sys/types.h: Changed type of pid_t to plain int. It
	needs to be signed.

	* include/unistd.h: Fixed prototypes of several functions to match
	POSIX standard.

2000-09-11  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/isoinfra.cdl: Add CYGBLD_ISO_{OPEN,LINK,NAME,PATH}_MAX_HEADER
	* include/limits.h: Support definition of OPEN_MAX, LINK_MAX,
	NAME_MAX, PATH_MAX

2000-08-30  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* include/assert.h (assert): Fix logic

2000-08-29  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* include/stddef.h: Don't use CYGONCE_ multiple header inclusion
	protection for this file - this is special.

2000-08-08  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* include/limits.h: Add SSIZE_MAX

2000-08-03  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* include/sys/types.h: Make fd_mask unsigned int, not cyg_uint32 so
	as to avoid including cyg_type.h

2000-08-01  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* cdl/isoinfra.cdl: Support termios
	* include/termios.h: Added

2000-07-21  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* cdl/isoinfra.cdl: CYGNUM_ISO_MQUEUE_OPEN_MAX and
	CYGNUM_ISO_MQUEUE_PRIO_MAX should only be active if CYGINT_ISO_MQUEUE
	rather than them requiring it

2000-07-20  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/isoinfra.cdl: Added configury for sys/utsname.h.

	* include/unistd.h: Added _POSIX_VERSION constant.
	Changed return type of sysconf() to long.

	* include/sys/utsname.h: Added this file.

2000-07-13  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/unistd.h: Added fsync() prototype.

2000-07-13  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* cdl/isoinfra.cdl: Add CYGINT_ISO_MALLINFO and 
	CYGBLD_ISO_MALLINFO_HEADER to support mallinfo()

	* include/stdlib.h: Support mallinfo()

2000-06-28  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/sys/stat.h: Added prototypes for stat(), fstat() and
	mkdir().

	* include/dirent.h: Added this file to provide directory reading
	support.

	* cdl/isoinfra.cdl: Added dirent support.

2000-06-21  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* cdl/isoinfra.cdl: Put in below requires line, but change to allow
	0 or 1 implementations

2000-06-19  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/isoinfra.cdl: Commented out requires line in
	CYGINT_POSIX_REALTIME_SIGNALS interface. This causes configuration
	errors when the POSIX package is absent.

	* include/sys/types.h: Reimplemented FD_COPY() and FD_ZERO() as
	inline copy loops rather than calls to memcpy() and memset(). 

2000-06-09  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* include/time.h: Following the below change, simply define struct
	timeval, while allowing it to be overridden if necessary
	* cdl/isoinfra.cdl (CYGBLD_ISO_STRUCTTIMEVAL_HEADER): define for this
	purpose

2000-06-09  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/time.h: Added definition of struct timeval. This is a
	temporary home for this while we work out where definitions like
	this should really live. Like the fd_set stuff in sys/types.h,
	this is needed by two packages, both of which can operate
	independently but which also need to co-operate when they are both
	present.

2000-06-07  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/sys/types.h: Added definitions for file descriptor sets
	and inclusion of BSD specific types.

	* include/stdlib.h: Added extern for environ variable in non-POSIX
	builds.

	* include/fcntl.h (O_WRONLY): Moved this to bit 1, leaving bit 2
	for future expansion.

	* cdl/isoinfra.cdl: Added CYGPKG_ISO_EXTRA_TYPES to control
	inclusion of types into <sys/types.h> that are not specified by
	POSIX. Mostly needed by the socket and BSD code.

2000-06-02  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/unistd.h: Added this initial version of this file. Jifl
	will probably want to rewrite it at some point.

	* include/fcntl.h: Changed O_RDWR to (O_RDONLY|O_WRONLY).

2000-05-31  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/fcntl.h: Fixed ifdefs around extern declaration of
	fcntl().

2000-05-20  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* include/fcntl.h: new file
	* include/mqueue.h: new file
	* include/sys/stat.h: new file

	* cdl/isoinfra.cdl: No need for memcpy and memset interfaces - they're
	always present
	(CYGINT_ISO_POSIX_TIMERS): define _POSIX_TIMERS if enabled
	(CYGINT_POSIX_REALTIME_SIGNALS): add
	(CYGPKG_ISO_POSIX_FCNTL): Add a number of hooks for things that need
	to control fcntl.h
	(CYGPKG_ISO_MQUEUE): Add a number of hooks for things that need
	to control mqueue.h
	(CYGBLD_ISO_STAT_DEFS_HEADER): Add to override default sys/stat.h
	contents
	
	Fix some typos throughout, and a few other minor tidies
	
	* include/limits.h: Move _POSIX_* macros here from POSIX package since
	they are implementation independent

	* include/time.h: Keep CLOCKS_PER_SEC at 1000000

	* include/sys/types.h: Bring some of the types more in line with Linux

	* include/ctype.h, include/errno.h, include/limits.h, include/locale.h,
	include/pthread.h, include/sched.h, include/semaphore.h,
	include/setjmp.h, include/signal.h, include/stdio.h, include/stdlib.h,
	include/string.h, include/time.h, include/sys/types.h:
	Don't need to explicitly check interface values > 0

2000-05-02  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* include/time.h: Provide default definitions of time_t, clock_t and
	CLOCKS_PER_SEC

	* cdl/isoinfra.cdl: Remove CYGINT_ISO_TIME_T and CYGINT_ISO_CLOCK_T -
	not really needed with a default definition

	* New package isoinfra with the following files:
	include/errno.h
	include/sys/types.h
	include/assert.h
	include/stddef.h
	include/string.h
	include/setjmp.h
	include/ctype.h
	include/float.h
	include/sched.h
	include/stdarg.h
	include/semaphore.h
	include/time.h
	include/signal.h
	include/locale.h
	include/pthread.h
	include/stdio.h
	include/stdlib.h
	include/limits.h
	cdl/isoinfra.cdl

	This package manages the ISO standard (C and POSIX) top-level header
	files
