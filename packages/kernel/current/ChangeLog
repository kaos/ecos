2000-10-30  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/synch.cdl: Replaced CYGINT_KERNEL_SCHEDULER_CAN_YIELD with
	CYGINT_KERNEL_SCHEDULER_UNIQUE_PRIORITIES.
	* cdl/scheduler.cdl:
	CYGSEM_KERNEL_SYNCH_MUTEX_PRIORITY_INVERSION_PROTOCOL requires
	CYGINT_KERNEL_SCHEDULER_UNIQUE_PRIORITIES.

	* tests/thread2.cxx: Use new option.
	* tests/klock.c: Same.
	* src/common/thread.cxx: Same.
	* src/common/clock.cxx: Same.

	* include/bitmap.hxx: Leave unique priority setting to CDL.
	* include/mlqueue.hxx: Same.
	* include/sched.hxx: Let CDL do sanity check of config.

2000-10-27  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/scheduler.cdl: Added CYGINT_KERNEL_SCHEDULER_CAN_YIELD

	* tests/klock.c: Avoid use of disabled features. Require scheduler
	that can yield.

	* include/intr.hxx (class Cyg_Interrupt): Make dsr_count volatile
	to prevent a potential race condition with overzealous C
	compilers.

2000-10-13  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/sched/sched.cxx (unlock_inner): Added condition to test for
	DSRs to only call DSRs when the scheduler lock is making a 0->1
	transition. Otherwise there is the danger of calling DSRs when the
	scheduler lock is > 1. This violates our original assumptions
	about how the scheduler lock worked with respect to DSR. 

	* src/intr/intr.cxx (call_pending_DSRs): Added assert to check
	that DSRs are only called when the scheduler lock is exactly 1.

2000-10-13  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/intr.hxx: Fixing syntax mistake; volatile keyword must
	appear after the type for it to affect the pointer variable.
	* src/intr/intr.cxx: Same. Remove volatile from local block.

2000-10-05  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.co.uk>

	* src/intr/intr.cxx: Made dsr_table_tail volatile as well.
	* include/intr.hxx: Ditto.

2000-10-05  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/sched/sched.cxx: 
	* include/sched.hxx: Converted asr_inhibit from a bool to a

	functions.

2000-10-04  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.co.uk>

	* include/intr.hxx: Made dsr_list volatile.
	* src/intr/intr.cxx: Same. Also fix compiler warning.

2000-09-25  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/sched/mlqueue.cxx:
	Added test for current thread not runnable in
	Cyg_Scheduler_Implementation::timeslice().  This is possible if a
	prior DSR has caused the current thread to be descheduled. Added
	an assert to Cyg_ThreadQueue_Implementation::rotate() for
	additional paranoia. (This problem was originally identified and
	fixed (differently) by Andrew Lunn <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>.)

2000-09-13  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/kexcept1.c (cause_exception): Use separate cause_fpe function.
	* tests/except1.cxx (cause_exception): Same.

	* tests/kexcept1.c (cause_exception): Do not use division at all.
	* tests/except1.cxx (cause_exception): Same.

2000-09-11  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/instrument.cdl (CYGVAR_KERNEL_INSTRUMENT_EXTERNAL_BUFFER): 
	Bring this option back from the dead

2000-09-08  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/sched.hxx:
	* include/sched.inl:
	Added Cyg_Scheduler::unlock_reschedule() function. This decrements
	the scheduler lock by one but also permits the current thread to
	be rescheduled if it ready to sleep, or there is a higher priority
	thread ready to run. This is to support use of various
	synchronization objects while the scheduler lock is claimed.

	* src/sched/sched.cxx (unlock_inner): Modified precondition to
	allow for functionality of unlock_reschedule().

	* src/sched/mlqueue.cxx:
	Now uses Cyg_SchedulerThreadQueue_Implementation for all runqueue
	pointers. It was using Cyg_ThreadQueue_Implementation in some
	places which meant we were trying to sort the run queues!
	Changed yield() so it can be called with the scheduler lock
	claimed.
	Changed Cyg_Scheduler_Implementation::timeslice() to rotate the
	queue itself rather than call yield(). The changes to yield() make
	it unsafe to call here any more.

	* include/mlqueue.hxx (class Cyg_SchedulerThreadQueue_Implementation): 
	Made enqueue() member public.
	
	* include/mboxt2.inl:
	* src/common/thread.cxx: 
	* src/sync/mutex.cxx: 
	* src/sync/cnt_sem2.cxx: 
	Removed assertions for zero scheduler lock and replaced some
	invocations of Cyg_Scheduler::unlock() with
	Cyg_Scheduler::unlock_reschedule() or Cyg_Scheduler::reschedule()
	where appropriate.

	* tests/klock.c:
	* cdl/kernel.cdl:
	Added klock.c to test functionality while scheduler lock is claimed.

2000-08-17  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/sched/sched.cxx (unlock_inner): Move an assert to some place
	where it's true *all* the time!  There was a narrow margin where a
	DSR could confuse unlock_inner() by reanimating the current thread
	before it had a chance to sleep - hence the call appears to be
	pointless.  Putting the assert before the DSR calls makes sense.

	* include/mboxt.inl:
	* src/sync/bin_sem.cxx:
	* src/sync/cnt_sem.cxx:
	* src/sync/flag.cxx:
	* src/sync/mutex.cxx:
	All of these now use Cyg_Scheduler::reschedule() rather than an
	unlock/lock pair to yield in their functions which can sleep.
	They therefore can be called safely and atomically with the
	scheduler already locked.  This is a Good Thing[tm].  Since the
	network stack synch primitives now use this feature, the asserts
	that the scheduler was not locked must disappear: this change.


2000-08-07  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* include/mutex.hxx (class Cyg_Mutex): Add comment explaining
	presence of locked.

2000-08-04  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* tests/stress_threads.c (STACK_SIZE_HANDLER): Increase stack sizes
	otherwise it crashes!

2000-07-31  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* include/mempolt2.hxx: As per change of 2000-07-04, also delete - left
	behind accidentally

2000-07-20  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/mutex.hxx (class Cyg_Mutex): Added get_ceiling()
	accessor function.

	* src/sched/mlqueue.cxx: Fixed bug in sorted queue code that
	resulted in an infinite loop if the thread being inserted is of
	lower priority than all threads in the queue. This case is now
	detected early.

2000-07-17  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* tests/kflag1.c (FIRST_THREAD_WAIT_TIME): Parameterize thread 
	synchronization wait times (for understanding) and adjust for
	incredibly slow platforms.  [Previous value allowed for the test
	to get out of sync because the code ran so slowly]

2000-07-04  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* cdl/kernel.cdl: Remove all configury related to memory allocators,
	including tests. Make CYGFUN_KERNEL_API_C require CYGFUN_MEMALLOC_KAPI

	* include/memfixed.hxx, include/mempolt2.inl, include/mempoolt.hxx,

	Move to separate memory allocator package CYGPKG_MEMALLOC
	
	* include/kapi.h, include/kapidata.h, src/common/kapi.cxx:
	Remove memory allocator functionality - now implemented in
	CYGPKG_MEMALLOC

	* tests/dhrystone.c:
	Update configuration dependencies for new isoinfra design
	* tests/stress_threads.c:
	Likewise.
	Also fix early termination after DEATH_TIME_LIMIT so that 
	allocated resources are freed, and so more appropriate
	statistics are reported
	Also update to use mallinfo() interface to memory allocator

2000-06-23  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/kapi.h (cyg_scheduler_read_lock): New function, to
	return the value of the scheduler lock; this for implementing SPLX
	in the network stack.

	* src/common/kapi.cxx (cyg_scheduler_read_lock): New function.

2000-06-20  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/sched/mlqueue.cxx (Cyg_ThreadQueue_Implementation::enqueue):
	Rewrote code to insert threads into priority sorted queue. The
	original code could not cope with a queue all of whose members
	were lower priority than the new thread - it looped for ever. Also
	provided fast paths for common and easily detected cases such as
	adding to a single element queue and adding at the front. By
	taking these cases out early, we can also simplify the code to
	search the queue.

2000-06-16  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/kernel.cdl: Remove exception tests for CMA230 - not supported
	by hardware.

2000-06-16  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/intr/intr.cxx (chain_isr): Only call default_isr if no isrs
	in the chain reacted to the interrupt.

2000-06-15  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/mutex.hxx (class Cyg_Condition_Variable): Added an
	inline function, get_queue(), to return a pointer to the
	underlying thread queue. To be used mainly for comparing with a
	thread's current queue to decide whether it is waiting for a
	condition variable.

	* include/kapi.h:
	* src/common/kapi.cxx: 
	Changed return type of cyg_semaphore_wait() to match existing
	behaviour of Cyg_Counting_Semaphore::wait().
	Changed return type of cyg_cond_wait() to match new behaviour of
	Cyg_Condition_Variable::wait().

2000-06-09  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/mutex.hxx:
	* src/sync/mutex.cxx:
	Modified non-timeout condition variable wait() API to return
	cyg_bool. A true result indicates that the wait() terminated
	normally. A false result indicates that the wait() was terminated
	as a result of a release() or destroy operation. For most uses
	this distinction is irrelevant, but in some situations it is a
	useful bit of information to have.
	Also modified timeout condition variable wait to reacquire the
	mutex under all circumstances. This is the correct and consistent
	thing to do.

2000-06-08  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/debug/dbg-thread-demux.c: Use generic HAL feature to allow
	ROM/RAM intercalling.

2000-06-06  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/kcache1.c (entry0): Skip invalidate tests on TX49. Too slow.

2000-05-30  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* tests/dhrystone.c: Increase number of test loops for faster
	StrongARM platforms.

2000-05-22  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* cdl/scheduler.cdl (CYGIMP_KERNEL_SCHED_SORTED_QUEUES): Disable by
	default

	* src/sched/mlqueue.cxx (enqueue): Add to end of thread queue even
	when not priority ordered

2000-05-20  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* include/mqueue.hxx, include/mqueue.inl:
	Add POSIX-style message queue implementation
	
	* cdl/kernel.cdl: Add mqueue1 test
	* cdl/scheduler.cdl: Add new CYGIMP_KERNEL_SCHED_SORTED_QUEUES option

	* include/sema.hxx: Need thread.inl header, not just thread.hxx
	Make Cyg_Counting_Semaphore::peek() const since it is

	* src/sync/cnt_sem.cxx, src/sync/cnt_sem2.cxx, include/sema2.hxx:
	Make Cyg_Counting_Semaphore{2}::peek() const since it is

	* include/thread.hxx: don't want Cyg_Thread_queue::empty() to be marked
	inline in the class def, otherwise we get warnings elsewhere

	* include/mlqueue.hxx (Cyg_ThreadQueue_Implementation):
	Add set_thread_queue private method
	Add derived class Cyg_SchedulerThreadQueue_Implementation, and
	make scheduler implementation use it instead of
	Cyg_ThreadQueue_Implementation
	
	* src/mlqueue.cxx: Fix typo
	Support  CYGIMP_KERNEL_SCHED_SORTED_QUEUES, i.e. allow insertion
	into thread queue in order of thread priority, with oldest at the
	front
	(Cyg_ThreadQueue_Implementation::set_thread_queue): Add
	(Cyg_SchedulerThreadQueue_Implementation::enqueue): Add, like old
	one, except make it FIFO instead of LIFO by inserting at end of queue

2000-05-16  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/dhrystone.c: More loops on the TX49

2000-05-15  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* cdl/counters.cdl (CYGVAR_KERNEL_COUNTERS_CLOCK_DSR_LATENCY): 
	Default to CYGVAR_KERNEL_COUNTERS_CLOCK_LATENCY

2000-05-04  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* include/instrmnt.h: Remove all CYG_UNUSED_PARAMs as they could
	cause problems when used with volatile arguments
	* src/intr/intr.cxx: Use CYG_UNUSED_PARAM to silence warning that
	appears because of the above change.

2000-05-02  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* tests/kintr0.c:
	* tests/intr0.cxx: Correct test for cases when VSR_MIN or
	ISR_MIN are not zero (bad assumption).

2000-05-02  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* cdl/thread.cdl (CYGNUM_KERNEL_THREADS_DATA_LIBC): Don't need libc
	slot. Replace with CYGNUM_KERNEL_THREADS_DATA_ERRNO slot instead.	

2000-04-28  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/sched/sched.cxx (unlock_inner):
	A significant change to the behaviour of this function.  The
	new_lock argument contains the value that the scheduler lock
	should have after this function has completed. If it is zero then
	the lock is being released and some extra work (running ASRs,
	checking for DSRs) is done before returning. If it is non-zero
	then it must equal the current value of the lock, and is used to
	indicate that we want to reacquire the scheduler lock before
	returning. This latter option only makes any sense if the current
	thread is no longer runnable, otherwise this function will do
	nothing.

	The result of this is that where we used to "blip" the scheduler
	lock to force a sleep, we now call reschedule(), which calls
	unlock_inner() with the current sched_lock value. The important
	difference is that there is not now the brief window between the
	calls where the lock is unclaimed. It also prevents ASRs being run
	at inopportune moments. In future this will also allow us to force
	threads to sleep even when they are deeply nested in the scheduler
	lock.

	* include/mutex.hxx:
	Added Cyg_Mutex::get_owner() to return pointer to owning thread.
	
	* include/sched.hxx:
	* include/sched.inl:	
	Added new_lock argument to unlock_inner(), added reschedule().
	Made set_asr_inhibit() and clear_asr_inhibit() available even when
	ASRs are disabled.

	* include/mboxt.inl:
	* src/sync/bin_sem.cxx: 
	* src/sync/cnt_sem.cxx:
	* src/sync/flag.cxx: 
	* src/sync/mutex.cxx: 
	Converted instances of "blipping" the scheduler lock into calls to
	Cyg_Scheduler::reschedule(), which is better behaved. Some calls
	to set_asr_inhibit() and clear_asr_inhibit() also added in various
	places.

2000-04-26  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/kcache1.c: Also to flush testing with unified caches.

	right thing, rather than simply checking reported priorities.

	* tests/PKGconf.mak: Add new kernel test mutex3, put in to test

	It is a child of ..._PRIORITY_INHERITANCE_SIMPLE and is really
	only there to turn off if you really want the old implementation.

	* src/sync/mutex.cxx (unlock): Add call to
	Cyg_SchedThread::relay_priority() when relinquishing the mutex, in
	order to relay any raised priority to the new owner.  Also count
	the mutex we are waiting for as well as those held for correct
	recovery in the case of inheriting priority then being killed, for
	example.

	let this work.

1999-08-23  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/intr0.cxx (vsr0): 
	* tests/kintr0.c (vsr0): 
	Add a comment to the effect that vsr0() is NOT a valid VSR on any
	known platform; VSRs must be writ in assembler.  Customer
	requested this, the examples are rather confusing otherwise.

	* include/pkgconf/kernel.h:
	* src/common/clock.cxx:
	* tests/tm_basic.cxx:
	Added CYGVAR_KERNEL_COUNTERS_CLOCK_DSR_LATENCY to enable recording
	of DSR latency figures. Added code controlled by this option to
	clock and tm_basic. Also made interrupt latency measurement
	primarily dependent on CYGVAR_KERNEL_COUNTERS_CLOCK_LATENCY since
	whether HAL_CLOCK_LATENCY is defined is not sufficient.

1999-08-17  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/counters.cdl, cdl/interrupts.cdl, cdl/scheduler.cdl:

	* tests/kcache1.c (entry0): Also perform timing tests with
	HAL_DCACHE_INVALIDATE_ALL and/or HAL_ICACHE_INVALIDATE_ALL in the

	spoil clock operation, so elapsed time appears to be 0.

	* tests/kcache2.c (entry0): Replace the "if (0)" for having a
	copy-back cache with a proper test on a HAL macro.  Even though I
	couldn't actually get those parts of the test to work on the
	platform I'm currently working on.

	Ditto set_timer().
	Changed a "clear_timer()" call to "timer.disable()" and added one
	so that they affect _this_ thread, the thread which is being
	kill()ed or reinitialize()d rather than the killer or the
	resuscitator.  Otherwise the alarm list can still get a loop in
	it when a thread's killed when waiting with a timeout and
	restarted soon enough.
	
1998-10-08  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	In general, these changes are to support create/delete of uITRON
	objects; this requires that an object can be destroyed whilst
	there are threads waiting on it, and that they shall be awoken
	with a specific return code.

	* include/thread.hxx:
	Cyg_Thread::DESTRUCT added to wake reasons, to deal with an object
	being destroyed whilst a thread is waiting on it; it's handled in
	a manner very similar to release() and BREAK wake_reason.
	
	* src/common/thread.cxx: 
	thread_entry(): threads now exit() if the entry_point returns.
	Cyg_Thread() constructors now initialize wake_reason to NONE.
	reinitialize() clears any pending timeout before calling
	constructors.
	counted_sleep( [timeout] ) now both deal with the wake reason in
	general, and with DESTRUCT in particular.
	exit() now clears any pending timeout.
	kill() now force_resumes the thread first.
	kill() now does not explicitly remove the thread from any queue
	it's on; wake() does that for you anyway.
	delay() clears the timer just in case and handles DESTRUCT
	properly.
	DESTRUCT added to various switches for completeness.

	The fixes to counted_sleep()[x2] and kill() are a bugfix for
	PR#17688.

	* include/flag.hxx:
	* src/sync/flag.cxx:
	Add an argument, defaulting to 0, to the constructor which sets
	the initial flag value.
	Add handing of DESTRUCT wake reason.
	Add a destructor which wakes all threads with DESTRUCT
	wake_reason.

1998-09-25  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/kernel.h:
	The GDB thread support requires the kernel to keep track of all
	threads on a linked list. This is a separate option. An additional
	requires statement enforces the dependency.
	
1998-09-25  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/debug/dbg-thread-demux.c:

1998-09-24  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/debug/dbg-thread-demux.c (dbg_thread_syscall_rmt):
	PR 17327. If kernel gdb thread support is disabled, do not compile
	in the relevant cases in the rmt switch statement. This is a
	partial solution to the general problem of how the HAL, kernel,
	cygmon, and gdb interact.

1998-09-24  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/common/clock.cxx (Cyg_RealTimeClock):
	Changed clock priority from zero to one, since it is now used to
	set the hardware interrupt priority.

	* src/intr/intr.cxx:
	Cyg_Interrupt::chain_isr() now only calls interrupt objects that
	have the matching vector number.
	Call HAL_INTERRUPT_SET_LEVEL() when attaching interrupts using the
	priority passed in the constructor.
	Added call to HAL_TRANSLATE_VECTOR() for attaching chained
	interrupts.

	* include/instrmnt.h (CYG_INSTRUMENT_EVENT_INTR_CHAIN_ISR):

	Move the code to synchronize a repeating alarm which had been

	Added an alternative constructor to Cyg_Thread which takes
	arguments in new order, and includes a scheduling parameters
	argument. Propagated effects of this through Cyg_SchedThread
