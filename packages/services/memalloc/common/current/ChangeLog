	check_alloced_memdq as inlines.

	* cdl/memalloc.cdl: Add new allocator supporting separate metadata,
	and the associated config options, and build sepmeta.cxx and tests.
	Build heapgeninc.tcl with macros that work with both gcc2 and gcc3.
	Ditto for heaps.o.

	* include/sepmeta.hxx, include/sepmetaimpl.hxx, include/sepmetaimpl.inl,
	src/sepmeta.cxx, tests/sepmeta1.cxx, tests/sepmeta2.cxx:

2001-07-18  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/heapgen.tcl: Use constructor priority of CYG_INIT_MEMALLOC
	for heap objects in generated heaps.cxx.

2001-07-12  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	by taking into account metadata.

2001-06-18  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/memalloc.cdl: Add heaptest test.

	* tests/heaptest.c: New test to do a memory check of all of heap.

2001-05-02  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/dlmalloc.cxx (Cyg_Mempool_dlmalloc_Implementation): Fix
	previous change; "top" is a pseudo variable via a NULL pointer if
	the heap is not initialized, so you can't use it as a flag for "no
	mem here"; and a typo, the comparison was reversed.  The two hid
	each other, so the check for "no mem here" usually said "OK".

2001-05-01  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/mvarimpl.inl (try_alloc): Allow zero sized heaps.
	(Cyg_Mempool_Variable_Implementation): Ditto.

2000-11-28  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/heapgen.tcl: Don't use cygpath -s for now as not all cygwins
	have it yet.

2000-11-25  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/memalloc.cdl: Make sure PWD variable doesn't clash with bash PWD
	by renaming to XPWD

2000-11-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/memalloc.cdl: Invoke heapgen.tcl with build directory
	surrounded by quotes (and do so in a portable way).

	* src/heapgen.tcl: recurse back in on cygwin with correct quoting
	to allow directories containing spaces. Also in a Solaris shell
	compatible way.

2000-11-21  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/memalloc.cdl (CYGSEM_MEMALLOC_MALLOC_ZERO_RETURNS_NULL):

	be returned on malloc(0).

2000-11-01  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/realloc.c (main): Use reasonable factor when making too
	large realloc (targets with 64MB would cause an overflow).

	* tests/memfix1.cxx:
	* tests/memfix2.cxx:
	* tests/memvar1.cxx:
	* tests/memvar2.cxx:
	Make sure default priority constructors have been invoked.

2000-09-14  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/realloc.c (main): fix warning.
	* tests/malloc1.c (main): Same.
	* tests/malloc2.c (main): Same.
	* tests/malloc3.c (main): Same.

2000-08-31  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

2000-08-02  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* src/heapgen.tcl: Fix tclsh invocation quoting problems

2000-07-31  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* cdl/memalloc.cdl: Work around NT cygtclsh80 bug by cd'ing into
	heapgen.tcl's directory before running it

2000-07-26  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* tests/malloc4.cxx: Call rand_r() rather than rand, and use a seed
	var in each thread.

2000-07-25  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* tests/malloc4.cxx (thrfree): Get mem size here. Tidy output.
	(thrmalloc): Get mem size in thrfree instead

	* src/heapgen.tcl: Refine search for user-defined name to cope with
	use of CYG_LABEL_DEFN macro

	Created as new package, merging existing memory allocator related stuff
	from the kernel and libc. Many bug fixes to existing stuff, as
	well as performance improvements, and extra features such as
	a port of dlmalloc, and the ability to support multiple disjoint
	heaps, possibly with run-time configurable size.
	There's even a bit of documentation, and some new tests
