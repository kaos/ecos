 - disable compression in commit_write()?
 - fine-tune the allocation / GC thresholds
 - chattr support - turning on/off and tuning compression per-inode
 - checkpointing (do we need this? scan is quite fast)
 - make the scan code populate real inodes so read_inode just after 
	mount doesn't have to read the flash twice for large files.
	Make this a per-inode option, changable with chattr, so you can
	decide which inodes should be in-core immediately after mount.
 - test, test, test

 - NAND flash support:
	- done :)

 - Optimisations:
   - Split writes so they go to two separate blocks rather than just c->nextblock.
	By writing _new_ nodes to one block, and garbage-collected REF_PRISTINE
	nodes to a different one, we can separate clean nodes from those which
	are likely to become dirty, and end up with blocks which are each far
	closer to 100% or 0% clean, hence speeding up later GC progress dramatically.
   - Stop keeping name in-core with struct jffs2_full_dirent. If we keep the hash in 
     the full dirent, we only need to go to the flash in lookup() when we think we've
     got a match, and in readdir(). 
   - Doubly-linked next_in_ino list to allow us to free obsoleted raw_node_refs immediately?
   - Remove totlen from jffs2_raw_node_ref? Need to have totlen passed into
	jffs2_mark_node_obsolete(). Can all callers work it out?
   - Remove size from jffs2_raw_node_frag.
